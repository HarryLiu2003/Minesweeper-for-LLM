--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, the initial move is typically a guess since the board is entirely covered. A common strategy is to start by clicking a cell near the center of the board to maximize the chance of revealing a large area. This approach increases the likelihood of uncovering multiple cells, providing more information to work with. Given the 5x5 board, the center cell is at (3,3). By left-clicking this cell, we aim to reveal a significant portion of the board, which will help us deduce the locations of the mines in subsequent moves.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let's examine the cell at (4,4), which displays the number "3". This indicates there are three mines among its neighboring cells. The unopened neighbors of (4,4) are (3,5), (4,5), and (5,4). Since there are exactly three unopened cells and the number on (4,4) is "3", it implies that all three of these cells must contain mines. We can safely flag one of these cells, such as (3,5), to mark it as a mine.

ACTION: R(3,5)

Your previous action "R(3,5)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot right-click a numbered cell. Right-click is only for unopened (`?') or flagged cells (`F').

REASONING: Apologies for the oversight. Let's revisit the cell at (4,4), which shows the number "3", indicating three mines among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors are (4,5), (5,4), and (5,5). Since there are exactly three unopened cells and the number on (4,4) is "3", all three of these cells must contain mines. We can safely flag one of these cells, such as (4,5), to mark it as a mine.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: With (4,5) flagged as a mine, we return to the cell at (4,4), which indicates there are three mines among its neighbors. The remaining unopened neighbors are (5,4) and (5,5). Since (4,4) requires three mines and one is already flagged at (4,5), the other two unopened cells, (5,4) and (5,5), must also be mines. We can safely flag one of these cells, such as (5,4), to mark it as a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Now that we have flagged three mines around (4,4), we can be confident that all the mines in that area have been accounted for. Let's examine the cell at (1,3), which shows the number "1". This indicates there is one mine among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (1,3) are (1,1) and (1,2). Since there is only one mine, and both (1,1) and (1,2) are unopened, we cannot determine which one is the mine yet. However, we can safely open the cell (2,1) because it is adjacent to (1,1) and (1,2), and it might give us more information.

ACTION: L(2,1)

Your previous action "L(2,1)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').
