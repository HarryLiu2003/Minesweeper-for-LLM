--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, starting with a cell that is not on the edge or corner of the board increases the likelihood of revealing more information about the surrounding cells. The center cell, (3,3), is a strategic choice for the first move because it maximizes the number of adjacent cells that can be revealed, providing a better understanding of the board layout. This initial move is safe since the first click in Minesweeper is always guaranteed not to hit a mine.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cells in the fourth row provide valuable information. The cell at (4,2) shows a "3", indicating that there are three mines among its neighboring cells. The unopened cells in the fifth row, specifically (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3), are the only possible locations for these mines. Since there are exactly three unopened cells adjacent to (4,2) and it indicates three mines, we can safely flag these cells as containing mines.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Continuing from the previous reasoning, the cell at (4,2) shows a "3", indicating three mines among its neighbors. With (5,1) already flagged, the remaining two mines must be in the unopened cells (5,2) and (5,3). Since these are the only possible locations for the remaining mines adjacent to (4,2), we can safely flag them as well.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,2) indicates there are three mines among its neighbors. With (5,1) and (5,2) already flagged, the last mine must be in (5,3). This is the only remaining unopened cell adjacent to (4,2) that can contain a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (5,3) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows a "2", indicating there are two mines among its neighboring cells. With (5,3) already flagged as a mine, only one more mine can be adjacent to (4,4). The unopened cells (5,4) and (5,5) are the only remaining candidates. However, the cell at (4,5) shows a "1", indicating only one mine is adjacent to it. Since (5,3) is already flagged, the remaining mine must be in (5,4). Therefore, we can safely flag (5,4) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We have flagged four mines, which is the total number of mines on the board. The cell at (4,5) shows a "1", indicating there is only one mine adjacent to it. Since (5,4) is already flagged as a mine, (5,5) cannot be a mine. Therefore, we can safely left-click on (5,5) to reveal it.

ACTION: L(5,5)
