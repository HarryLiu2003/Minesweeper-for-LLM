--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, the initial move is typically a random guess since the board is entirely covered. A common strategy is to start by clicking a cell near the center of the board, as this often maximizes the number of cells revealed and provides more information to work with. Given the 5x5 board, the center cell is at (3,3). By left-clicking this cell, we aim to uncover a significant portion of the board, which will help us deduce the locations of the mines in subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Let's examine the cell at (2,1), which displays the number "1". This indicates there is exactly one mine in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). Among these, (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2) are already opened and are not mines. The cell (3,2) is also opened and shows a "1", which means it has one mine in its neighboring cells. Therefore, the only unopened cell that could contain a mine is (3,1). We can safely deduce that (3,1) contains a mine and should be flagged.

REASONING: Let's focus on the cell at (1,4), which displays the number "2". This indicates there are two mines in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells are (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). Among these, (1,3) and (2,3) are already opened and are not mines. The cell (2,4) is also opened and shows a "2", which means it has two mines in its neighboring cells. The unopened cells (1,5) and (2,5) are the only candidates for these mines. However, since (2,4) already has one flagged mine at (3,1), the other mine must be in one of these two cells. We cannot definitively determine which one is a mine yet, so let's look at another cell.

The cell (3,2) shows "1", and since (3,1) is flagged, all its mines are accounted for. Therefore, we can safely open the cell (4,1).

REASONING: Let's examine the cell at (4,1), which displays the number "2". This indicates there are two mines in its neighboring cells. The neighboring cells are (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), and (5,2). Among these, (3,1) is already flagged as a mine, and (3,2) and (4,2) are opened and not mines. Therefore, there is one more mine among the unopened cells (5,1) and (5,2). 

The cell (5,2) shows "1", indicating it has one mine in its neighboring cells. Since (3,1) is already flagged, the only other possibility for a mine is (5,1). Thus, we can safely flag (5,1) as a mine.

REASONING: Now that (5,1) is flagged, let's revisit the cell at (4,1), which shows "2". With (3,1) and (5,1) both flagged, all mines around (4,1) are accounted for. This means we can safely open the remaining neighboring cells of (4,1) that are not flagged. The only unopened cell left is (5,2), but it is already opened. 

Let's look at the cell (1,4), which shows "2". It has two unopened neighbors: (1,5) and (2,5). Since (2,4) also shows "2" and has (3,1) flagged, the remaining mine must be in either (1,5) or (2,5). However, since (2,4) already accounts for one mine at (3,1), the other mine must be in (2,5). Therefore, we can safely flag (2,5).

REASONING: With (2,5) flagged, let's revisit the cell at (1,4), which shows "2". It has two flagged neighbors: (2,5) and one more unopened cell, (1,5). Since (1,4) already accounts for two mines, and both (2,5) and (3,1) are flagged, we can safely open (1,5) because it cannot contain a mine.
