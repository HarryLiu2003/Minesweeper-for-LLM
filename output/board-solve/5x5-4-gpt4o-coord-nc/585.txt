--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, the initial move is typically a guess since the board is entirely covered. A common strategy is to start by clicking a cell near the center of the board, as this often maximizes the number of cells that can be revealed in one move. This approach increases the likelihood of uncovering a large area, providing more information to work with for subsequent moves. Given the 5x5 board, the center cell is at (3,3). By left-clicking this cell, we aim to reveal a significant portion of the board, which will help us deduce the locations of the mines in future moves.

REASONING: The cell at (2,2) displays the number "1", indicating there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The unopened cells adjacent to (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1). Since there is only one mine among these, and (2,3) is already opened and safe, we can deduce that one of these three cells contains the mine. However, the cell at (3,2) shows "2", meaning there are two mines among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (3,2) are (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1). Given that (2,2) already accounts for one mine, and (3,2) needs two, it is safe to assume that (1,1) and (1,2) are not mines. Therefore, we can safely open (1,1).

REASONING: The cell at (1,3) displays the number "1", indicating there is one mine in its neighboring cells. The unopened neighbors of (1,3) are (1,4), (2,4), and (2,5). The cell at (2,4) shows "2", meaning there are two mines among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (2,4) are (1,4), (2,5), and (3,4). Since (3,4) is already opened and safe, and (1,3) accounts for one mine, it is likely that (1,4) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (1,4) as a potential mine.

REASONING: With (1,4) flagged as a mine, we can reassess the situation around the cell (2,4), which shows "2". This indicates there are two mines among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (2,4) are (2,5) and (3,1). Since (1,4) is already flagged as a mine, there must be one more mine among (2,5) and (3,1). The cell (3,2) shows "2", and its unopened neighbors are (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1). Since (2,1) is already opened and safe, and (3,2) needs two mines, it is likely that (3,1) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,1) as a potential mine.

REASONING: With (1,4) and (3,1) flagged as mines, we can further analyze the board. The cell at (2,4) shows "2", indicating two mines among its neighbors. With (1,4) already flagged, the remaining unopened neighbor is (2,5). Since (3,1) is also flagged, and (2,4) needs two mines, (2,5) must be safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (3,2) shows "2", and with (3,1) flagged, the remaining unopened neighbor (4,1) must be safe to open as well. Let's start by opening (2,5).
