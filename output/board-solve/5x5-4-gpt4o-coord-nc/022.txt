--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, the initial move is always safe, as the game ensures that the first cell you open is not a mine. A common strategy is to start by opening a cell near the center of the board to maximize the number of cells that can be revealed and provide more information about the surrounding area. This helps in making more informed decisions for subsequent moves. Therefore, we will begin by left-clicking the center cell at (3, 3).

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let's examine the board for cells with numbers that can help us identify mines. The cell at (2,4) shows a "2", indicating there are two mines among its neighboring cells. The unopened neighbors are (1,5) and (2,5). The cell at (3,4) shows a "1", and its only unopened neighbor is (3,5). Since (3,4) has only one unopened neighbor, (3,5) must be a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (3,5) as a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Now that (3,5) is flagged as a mine, we can use this information to safely open other cells. The cell at (2,4) shows a "2", and with (3,5) flagged, it indicates that there is one more mine among its remaining unopened neighbors, which are (1,5) and (2,5). However, the cell at (1,4) shows a "1", and its only unopened neighbor is (1,5). This means (1,5) must be a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (1,5) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: With (1,5) and (3,5) flagged as mines, we can further analyze the board. The cell at (2,4) shows a "2", and both potential mine locations (1,5) and (3,5) are flagged, indicating that all mines around (2,4) have been accounted for. Therefore, the remaining unopened neighbor of (2,4), which is (2,5), must be safe to open.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let's examine the cell at (2,5), which now shows a "2". This indicates there are two mines among its neighboring cells. The flagged cell (1,5) is one of these mines. The remaining unopened neighbors of (2,5) are (3,1) and (3,5), but (3,5) is already flagged. Therefore, the only remaining possibility for the second mine is (3,1). We can safely flag (3,1) as a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Now that (3,1) is flagged as a mine, let's look at the cell (4,2), which shows a "2". This indicates there are two mines among its neighboring cells. The flagged cell (3,1) is one of these mines. The remaining unopened neighbors of (4,2) are (4,1) and (5,1). Since (4,2) already accounts for one mine with (3,1), and there are no other flagged cells around it, we can deduce that (4,1) and (5,1) are safe to open. Let's start by opening (4,1).

ACTION: L(4,1)
