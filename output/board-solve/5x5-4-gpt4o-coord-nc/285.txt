--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: In Minesweeper, the initial move is typically a guess since the board is entirely covered. A common strategy is to start by clicking a cell near the center of the board, as this often maximizes the number of cells that can be revealed, providing more information to work with. By selecting the center cell at (3,3), we aim to uncover a significant portion of the board, which will help us deduce the locations of the mines more effectively.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Let's examine the cell at (2,2), which displays the number "3". This indicates that there are three mines among its neighboring cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1). The cell at (3,2) shows "2", meaning it has two mines among its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (3,2) are (2,1), (3,1), and (3,5). Since (2,2) and (3,2) share the unopened cells (2,1) and (3,1), and (3,2) only needs two mines, it is likely that (2,1) and (3,1) are mines. This leaves (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) as potential mines for (2,2). However, since (2,3) is "1" and (2,2) is "3", (1,2) must be a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (1,2).

REASONING: With (1,2) flagged as a mine, let's revisit the cell at (2,2), which indicates there are three mines among its neighbors. The remaining unopened neighbors are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1). The cell at (3,2) shows "2", and with (1,2) flagged, it suggests that two of its neighbors are mines. Since (2,1) and (3,1) are shared between (2,2) and (3,2), and (3,2) needs two mines, it is likely that (2,1) and (3,1) are mines. Therefore, we can safely flag (2,1).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Now that (2,1) and (1,2) are flagged, let's reassess the situation. The cell at (2,2) indicates three mines among its neighbors, and with (1,2) and (2,1) flagged, there is one more mine among (1,1), (1,3), and (3,1). The cell at (3,2) shows "2", and with (2,1) flagged, it suggests that one more of its neighbors is a mine. Since (3,1) is a shared neighbor between (2,2) and (3,2), and (3,2) needs one more mine, it is likely that (3,1) is a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (3,1).

REASONING: With (1,2), (2,1), and (3,1) flagged, let's analyze the board further. The cell at (2,2) indicates three mines among its neighbors, and all three potential mines have been flagged. This means the remaining neighbors of (2,2), which are (1,1) and (1,3), must be safe to open. Additionally, the cell at (2,3) shows "1", and with (2,1) flagged, it confirms that the other neighbors of (2,3) are safe. Therefore, we can safely left-click on (1,1).

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) shows "2", indicating there are two mines among its neighbors. With (1,2) already flagged, there is one more mine among (1,3) and (2,1). Since (2,1) is also flagged, this confirms that both mines for (1,1) are accounted for. Therefore, the remaining unopened neighbor of (1,1), which is (1,3), must be safe to open. We can safely left-click on (1,3).
