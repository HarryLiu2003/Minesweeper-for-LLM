--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the game is just starting and no cells have been opened, we follow the recommendation provided to begin by left-clicking the center cell at (3,3). This move is a natural starting point that will likely reveal some useful information to help us progress in deducing the positions of the mines later.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining cell (2,1), which displays "1", its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). The cells at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) are already open and known to be safe. This leaves (3,1) as the only unopened neighbor. Since (2,1) indicates there is exactly one mine among its neighbors, (3,1) must be that mine. Therefore, the next logical action is to flag (3,1).

REASONING: Looking at cell (1,4), which displays "1", its neighbors include (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). All these except (1,5) are already open and safe. Since (1,4) requires exactly one mine among its neighbors, the unopened (1,5) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag cell (1,5).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Observing cell (2,2) which displays "1", we note that its eight neighboring cells include one flagged cell at (3,1) and two unopened cells at (2,3) and (3,3). Since (2,2)'s count is exactly 1 and that mine is already flagged at (3,1), the two remaining unopened neighbors must be safe to open. We can proceed by left-clicking one of them. Here, we'll choose cell (2,3).

ACTION: L(2,3)

>> USER:
Your previous action "L(2,3)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').

REASONING: Consider cell (3,2), which is marked “1”. Its eight neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). Among these, (3,1) is flagged and the others are open except (4,1). Since the "1" on (3,2) is already satisfied by the flagged (3,1), the remaining unopened neighbor (4,1) cannot be a mine. Therefore, it is safe to left-click on (4,1).

REASONING: Consider cell (4,1) which shows “2”. Its neighbors are (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (4,2)=3, (5,1)=? and (5,2)=?. To reach its indicated count of 2, and with (3,1) already flagged, exactly one of (5,1) and (5,2) must be a mine. Next, check cell (4,2)=3. Its neighbors include (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=., (4,1)=2, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, and (5,3)=?. Since (3,1) is flagged and (3,3) is open, the three unknowns in row5 together must account for 2 more mines. Evaluating common constraints from neighboring cells (including (4,3)=1 and (5,4)=1) leads to two possibilities; however, in both, cell (5,1) emerges as a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (5,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We now have three unopened cells: (5,2), (5,3), and (5,5). Two independent constraints govern these cells. Cell (4,2)=3 has two flagged neighbors [(3,1) and (5,1)] and two unknown neighbors ((5,2) and (5,3)); so exactly one of (5,2) or (5,3) is a mine. Also, cell (5,4)=1 requires that exactly one mine exists among its two unknown neighbors: (5,3) and (5,5). These constraints yield two possibilities: either (5,3) is the mine (making (5,2) and (5,5) safe) or (5,3) is safe (forcing both (5,2) and (5,5) to be mines). Unfortunately, no cell is safe in every scenario. We must guess. Considering that a correct guess here might reveal more information, we choose (5,2) for a left-click.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (4,2)=3, its neighbors are (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=., (4,1)=2, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=F, (5,2)=2, and (5,3)=?. With (3,1) and (5,1) already flagged, there are two confirmed mines. Thus, (4,2)'s count of 3 requires that the remaining unknown neighbor, (5,3), must also be a mine. This deduction is also consistent with nearby values such as (5,4)=1. Therefore, we should flag cell (5,3).

ACTION: R(5,3)
