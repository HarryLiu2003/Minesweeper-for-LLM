--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the board is completely unopened, our only option is to pick an initial starting cell. The center cell (3,3) is a common choice because it maximizes the number of adjacent cells that could be revealed, potentially providing the most immediate information about surrounding mines. This strategy is typical for a Minesweeper opening move, helping to avoid early isolation to any board corner, and it adheres to the provided guide for the first move.

REASONING: Analyzing the cell at (1,2), which displays a “2”, we note that its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). Among these, (1,3), (2,2), and (2,3) are already revealed and safe. This leaves only (1,1) and (2,1) as unknown neighbors. To satisfy the “2” on (1,2), both (1,1) and (2,1) must be mines. Thus, we can confidently flag (1,1) as a mine.

REASONING: Focusing on the cell at (1,2) which shows a "2", its neighboring cells are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). We already flagged (1,1) as a mine. The cells (1,3), (2,2), and (2,3) are revealed and known to be safe. This leaves only (2,1) as the remaining neighbor. Since (1,2) requires two mines around it and one is already flagged at (1,1), (2,1) must also be a mine. We can safely flag it.

REASONING: Examining the neighbors of the cell at (2,2) which displays a "2", we note its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Among these, (1,1) and (2,1) are flagged as mines, and the remaining cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,2), and (3,3) are already revealed safe. This satisfies the "2" indicated on (2,2), meaning the only unrevealed neighbor (3,1) must be safe. Therefore, we can safely open the cell at (3,1).

REASONING: Consider cell (3,1) which displays "2". Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). Among these, (2,1) is already flagged and the rest are revealed safe except (4,1). Since one mine is already identified (at (2,1)), (4,1) must be the second mine surrounding (3,1). Therefore, we can confidently flag the cell at (4,1).
