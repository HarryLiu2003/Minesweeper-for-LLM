--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since no cells have been opened yet, our best strategic move is to start with a cell that offers maximum information. The center cell (3,3) is ideal because it is surrounded by the most cells, and opening it has the potential to reveal a large area if it is blank, or at least provide valuable numerical clues to guide our next moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: The cell at (1,2) displays a "1". Its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). Out of these, (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) are already opened (with either numbers or blanks), leaving only (1,1) as the unopened cell. Since the number "1" indicates exactly one mine is present among the adjacent cells, (1,1) must be a mine. Thus, we can safely flag (1,1).

REASONING: Let’s inspect the cell at (2,4) which shows a "1". Its eight adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). All except (3,5) are already revealed as safe cells (either blank or numbered). Since (2,4) requires exactly one mine among its neighbors and only (3,5) remains unknown, (3,5) must contain a mine. Therefore, we flag (3,5) as a mine.

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,2) which shows "1", its adjacent cells include (1,1) [F], (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). With (1,1) flagged as a mine, the count of flagged mines meets the cell’s number. Therefore, every other adjacent unknown cell must be safe. Among these, (2,3) is still unopened. We can safely left-click (2,3).

Since the flagged cell (3,5) accounts for the single mine indicated by (4,5), the remaining adjacent unopened cells must be safe. Choosing one, we can safely left-click (5,4).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on the lower section, consider cell (4,2), which displays "2". Its neighbors are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Among these, (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), and (4,3) are opened and safe. Thus, the two mines indicated by the "2" must lie among the three unopened cells: (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Additionally, cell (4,1) shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (5,1) and (5,2) (its other neighbors are safe); hence, exactly one mine exists among (5,1) and (5,2). To satisfy both cells, (5,3) must be the second mine adjacent to (4,2). Therefore, we can safely flag cell (5,3).
