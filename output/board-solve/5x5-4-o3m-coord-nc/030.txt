--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, and we have no clues yet. A common strategy in Minesweeper is to open the center cell, as it has the potential to reveal many adjacent cells if it's blank, giving us a strong start to gather crucial information for future moves.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Look at cell (4,5) which displays a "1" and has two unopened neighbors: (5,4) and (5,5). This tells us exactly one of these must be a mine. Now, cell (4,4) displays a "1" as well and touches three unopened cells: (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Since (5,4) and (5,5) together already contain exactly one mine (as indicated by (4,5)), the cell (5,3) cannot be a mine. Hence, (5,3) is safe to left-click.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: No move is immediately forced by pure logic at the moment. However, we can assess risk by looking at the clues. For instance, cell (2,2) showing a “1” touches exactly five unknown cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1). This means among these five cells, exactly one is a mine—a relatively low density compared to some other border groups. In contrast, groups like those touching (2,5) or (4,5) have a 50% mine chance. By selecting a cell from the five with only a 20% chance on average (if the mine is randomly distributed in that group), we minimize risk. Therefore, I will choose (1,1) as my next move.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,3) which shows "1", we examine its neighbors. Its eight surrounding cells are (1,2): opened with ".", (1,3): "1", (1,4): unknown, (2,2): "1", (2,4): "1", (3,2): "2", (3,3): ".", and (3,4): ".". Out of these, only (1,4) remains unopened. Since (2,3) requires exactly one adjacent mine and it already has only one candidate cell, (1,4) must be a mine.

REASONING: Examining cell (2,1) which displays "1", its neighbors include (1,1): ".", (1,2): ".", (2,2): "1", (3,1): "?", and (3,2): "2". Since three of its neighbors are already open and with no flags present, the only remaining candidate to fulfill the clue is (3,1). Therefore, (3,1) must contain a mine, and we flag it.

Only one mine has been flagged, namely (3,1). Since (3,2) requires two adjacent mines, the remaining mine from its neighbors must be (4,1). Therefore, (4,1) is a mine and should be flagged.
