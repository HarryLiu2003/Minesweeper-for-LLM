--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is entirely unopened, so we have no revealed information to guide our moves. As a first move, it is common practice to click in the center to maximize the potential for opening adjacent cells and obtaining more clues. Therefore, I will begin by left-clicking the center cell at (3,3).

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Looking at cell (1,3), which shows a 1, its only adjacent unopened cell is (1,2) since its neighbors are (1,2), (1,4) and (2,2),(2,3),(2,4), and all but (1,2) are already open and safe. Thus, (1,2) must contain the mine.

REASONING: The cell at (2,1) shows a 1 and its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). With (1,2) already flagged, the sole mine adjacent to (2,1) is accounted for. This means that the other adjacent unopened cells, including (1,1), must be safe. Therefore, we can safely left-click (1,1).

REASONING: The cell at (1,3) displays "1" and its neighboring cells include (1,2) which is flagged, (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Since the single mine adjacent to (1,3) is already flagged at (1,2), the remaining unopened neighbors, including (1,4), must be safe.

REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows a "3" and its eight neighbors are {(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)}. Among these, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), and (5,3) are already open. The remaining three unopened cells—(4,5), (5,4), and (5,5)—are exactly three. Since there are no flags among these and the clue states there should be three adjacent mines, all these must be mines. We can flag one of them.

Since (2,1)'s single adjacent mine is accounted for by the flag at (1,2), any remaining unopened neighbor—specifically (3,2)—must be safe to open.

REASONING: Consider cell (5,3) which displays "1". Its neighbors are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), and (5,4). All neighbors are open except (5,4). Given that the clue is "1" and no flags have been placed around it yet, the single mine must reside in the unopened cell at (5,4). Therefore, we should flag (5,4) as a mine.

The remaining neighbors (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), and (5,3) are already open, leaving only (5,5) unopened. Since the clue "3" demands three mines around (4,4) and only two are flagged so far, (5,5) must be the third mine.
