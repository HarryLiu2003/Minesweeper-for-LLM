--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Starting the game in Minesweeper requires a move that ideally opens up a significant area. Left-clicking on the center cell (3,3) is a common and strategic approach because it maximizes the possibility of revealing multiple cells around it. This first move is safe since, by the game rules, the first click never hits a mine, allowing us to gather vital initial clues for future moves.

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,1) which shows a "1", its adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). All of these are already opened and safe except for (3,1), which remains unknown. Since (2,1) demands exactly one mine among its neighbors, (3,1) must contain the mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (3,1).

REASONING: Consider cell (2,2) displaying a "1". Its adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Out of these, (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and (3,2) are either opened or, in the case of (3,1), flagged as a mine. With one flag already placed at (3,1) satisfying the mine count of "1", the remaining unopened adjacent cell (3,3) must be safe. Therefore, we can confidently left-click on (3,3).

REASONING: Consider cell (3,2) which shows a "2". Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). Among these, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,2), and (4,3) are already opened, and (3,1) is flagged. That leaves (4,1) as the only unopened neighbor. Since (3,2) requires a total of two mines and one is flagged (at 3,1), the remaining mine must be at (4,1). Thus, we flag (4,1).

REASONING: Cell (3,2) displays a "2" and has eight neighbors. Its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). Among these, (3,1) and (4,1) are flagged, satisfying the mine count. All other adjacent cells are already opened except (4,3), which is still unknown. Since the two displayed mines have been flagged, any remaining adjacent cell must be safe. Therefore, we can safely left-click on (4,3).

REASONING: Analyzing (2,4)=2, its neighbors include the unopened cells (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5) (with all other neighbors already revealed). Therefore, exactly 2 mines are among these three cells. Next, check (3,4)=1 whose neighbors include (2,5) and (3,5) as the only unopened cells, so exactly one mine lies there. Combining these facts, the remaining mine required for (2,4)=2 must be at (1,5). Thus, we can safely flag (1,5) as a mine.

REASONING: Both cells (2,5) and (3,5) are the only unopened cells around (2,4)=2 and (3,4)=1. Analysis shows that exactly one of these two must contain a mine. With no additional information to differentiate them, neither can be declared completely safe based solely on matching counts. In such a scenario, a common Minesweeper strategy is to make an educated guess. I will choose to left-click on (2,5) as my next move.

ACTION: L(2,5)
