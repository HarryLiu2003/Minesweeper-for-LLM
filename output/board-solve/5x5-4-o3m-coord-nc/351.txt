--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since all cells are unopened at the start, we follow a common Minesweeper strategy by beginning with the center cell to potentially reveal a large area and gain information. The center position (3,3) is ideal because it maximizes the chance of uncovering multiple adjacent cells if it's blank, which will help guide subsequent moves.

REASONING: Looking at cell (4,4) which shows "1", its eight neighbors are mostly revealed. The only unrevealed neighbor is (3,5), meaning it must contain the sole adjacent mine. Therefore, we flag cell (3,5) as a mine.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (3,4) which shows "1", we note that its eight neighbors include only one unrevealed cell, (2,5), with the remainder already opened or flagged. Importantly, one neighbor (3,5) is flagged. Since the flagged count (1) matches the number on (3,4), it implies that any remaining neighboring unrevealed cells are safe. Thus, we can confidently middle-click on (3,4) to automatically open cell (2,5).

Out of these, (1,4), (2,4) and (3,4) are already opened and the cell (3,5) is flagged—providing exactly one flagged neighbor which matches the cell’s number. This means all remaining unopened neighboring cells (in this case, only (1,5)) are safe to open. Therefore, we can confidently use a middle-click on (2,5) to reveal its unopened neighbors.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining the board, we have a cluster of unknowns in the upper‐left region. The numbered cells (2,2)=2, (3,2)=1, and (5,2)=1 yield the following deductions regarding the unknown cells in their neighbors: From (2,2)=2, among the hidden cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) there must be exactly one mine. From (3,2)=1, among (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) there is exactly one mine. Also, (5,2)=1 tells us that between (4,1) and (5,1) there is exactly one mine. Solving these equations together, we find there are two consistent scenarios. In one, the mine in the top triplet falls in either (2,1) or (3,1) would be safe in the lower groups; in the other, (2,1) and (3,1) are mine‐free while the mine shifts to (1,1)/(4,1)/(5,1). Evaluating safety probabilities, cells (2,1) and (3,1) appear to be safest candidates (roughly an 83% chance of being safe). While not 100% guaranteed, this is our best logical option.
