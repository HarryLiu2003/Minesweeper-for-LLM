--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: At the start of the game, no cells have been revealed, so the safest approach is to begin from the center. This move provides maximum potential exposure to adjacent cells, which will supply crucial information about mine locations anywhere on the board as numbers are revealed. By left-clicking the center cell at (3,3), we can initiate our strategy to systematically analyze the surrounding clues and deduce the positions of the hidden mines.

ACTION: L(3,3)

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows the number "1" and its eight neighboring cells have been mostly uncovered except for (5,3), which is the only unknown cell among its neighbors: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) are all open. Since exactly one mine should be adjacent to (4,4) and no mines have been flagged yet there, (5,3) must be the mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (5,3) using a right-click.

REASONING: Considering cell (4,4) which shows "1," its eight neighbors include (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Already, (5,3) is flagged and (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), and (5,4) are opened; therefore, the only remaining unknown neighbors are (3,3) and (5,5). Since (4,4) requires exactly one mine and that is already flagged at (5,3), both (3,3) and (5,5) must be safe. Choosing one safe cell, I will left-click on (3,3).

REASONING: For cell (5,4) showing "1", its valid neighbors are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), and (5,5). Among these, (5,3) is flagged, which fulfills the count of “1” mine. Thus, any still-unopened neighbors must be safe. Since (5,5) remains unopened, it is safe to clear that cell.

REASONING: Look at cell (2,2) with value "2". Its unknown neighbors are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1). Also, cell (1,2) with value "1" indicates that exactly one of (1,1) and (2,1) is a mine. Therefore, to satisfy both clues, (3,1) must be a mine and (1,1) must also be a mine so that (2,2)’s total mine count is reached. Now, cell (3,2) with value "1" and unknown neighbors (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1) confirms (3,1) is the single mine among them, making (2,1) and (4,1) safe. Thus, (2,1) is safe to open.

REASONING: Considering cell (2,1) with value "2," its only two unknown neighbors are (1,1) and (3,1), which means both must be mines. Therefore, (1,1) and (3,1) are definitively mines. As a next step, we can safely mark one of these mine locations. I will flag the cell at (1,1).
