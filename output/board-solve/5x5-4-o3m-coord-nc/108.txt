--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: With a fully covered board and no additional clues to work on, we follow the standard strategy and the provided instruction to open the center cell. Left-clicking the center cell (3,3) offers the highest chance to reveal a large area if it turns out to be blank, which should help in gathering crucial information for subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Observing (4,1) shows a 1 with unknown neighbors (5,1) and (5,2), meaning exactly one mine exists between these two cells. Meanwhile, (4,2) shows a 1 with unknown neighbors (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Since (4,1)'s count guarantees that one mine exists in (5,1) or (5,2), cell (5,3) cannot be a mine without exceeding (4,2)’s count. Therefore, (5,3) is safe to open.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,1) displays a 1 and touches only two unknown cells in Row1: (1,1) and (1,2) (its other neighbors at (3,1) and (3,2) are already safe). This means exactly one mine exists between (1,1) and (1,2). Meanwhile, (2,2) also shows 1 and touches (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) among others; since (1,1) and (1,2) already account for one mine from (2,1), (1,3) must be mine-free. Therefore, the cell at (1,3) can be safely opened.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We now face ambiguity in the top row where constraints from (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) lead to two valid mine placements—one possibility with mines at (1,1) and (1,4), and the other with a mine at (1,2). This leaves cells in the top row uncertain. In contrast, overall there are 12 unknown cells with 4 mines remaining, averaging about a 33% chance per cell with some cells likely having an even lower risk. Considering its location, (5,5) is only constrained by (4,4)=1, whose other unknown neighbors (3,5), (4,5), and (5,4) share the mine possibility. Thus, (5,5) appears to be one of the less pressured cells, making it the best candidate for a guess. We accept a calculated risk here and proceed by left-clicking (5,5).

REASONING: Focusing on cell (4,3) which shows a 1, examine its neighbors: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), and (5,4). Out of these, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), and (5,4) are revealed safe cells. The sole unrevealed neighbor is (5,2). With a count of 1, this means (5,2) must contain a mine.

REASONING: Looking at (3,4)=2, its adjacent cells include two unknowns—(2,5) and (3,5)—with all other neighbors already revealed as safe. To satisfy the count of 2, both (2,5) and (3,5) must contain mines. We can thus safely flag one of these cells. I will flag (2,5) now.

Since (2,4)’s number is 2 and we already have 2 flags (at (2,5) and (3,5)) among its neighbors, the remaining unrevealed cells adjacent to (2,4) — namely (1,4) and (1,5) — must be safe. We can thus use a middle-click on (2,4) to automatically reveal (1,4) and (1,5).
