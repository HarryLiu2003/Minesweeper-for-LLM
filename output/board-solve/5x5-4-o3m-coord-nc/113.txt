--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: All cells are currently unopened. As the first move, and to maximize information about the board, we follow the instruction to left-click the center cell. Revealing cell (3,3) is a common opening strategy in Minesweeper as it typically gives insight into a large number of surrounding cells, allowing us to make informed decisions in subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider the constraints imposed by cells (2,1) and (2,2). Let (1,1) and (1,2) be represented as variables a and b, and (1,3) as c, where a value of 1 indicates a mine. The cell (2,1) shows 1, implying a + b = 1. The cell (2,2) also shows 1, but its neighborhood includes a, b, and c, meaning a + b + c = 1. Subtracting these equations shows that c = 0. Hence, (1,3) cannot be a mine and is safe to reveal.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Analyzing (4,1) and (4,2): (4,1)=1 has neighbors (5,1) and (5,2) unknown, so exactly one mine is in those two cells. Then (4,2)=1, with unknown neighbors (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3), implies that the total mines in these three equals 1. Since (5,1)+(5,2) are already known to sum to 1 (from (4,1)), it follows that (5,3) must be free of a mine and is safe to reveal.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: After our initial deductions the board now presents several 50/50 situations. For instance, (2,1)=1 and (2,2)=1 imply that among (1,1) and (1,2) exactly one is a mine. Similarly, (2,3)=1 forces that one of (1,2) and (1,4) is a mine. Despite these interlocking constraints, no cell can be guaranteed safe by pure logic. Faced with several “guess” scenarios, we choose one from the top row. Although (1,1) is 50/50, it is as reasonable a candidate as any. In tricky positions like these, selecting one cell to probe is often necessary. Therefore, I will left-click (1,1).

REASONING: Looking at (2,1) which displays a 1, its neighbors are (1,1)=1, (1,2)=? (unknown), (2,2)=1, (3,1)=. (blank), and (3,2)=. (blank). Since none of the opened neighbors are mines, the single mine indicated by (2,1) must be in the only unopened neighbor: (1,2). Therefore, we deduce that cell (1,2) contains a mine and it should be flagged.

REASONING: Looking at (2,3)=1, its eight neighbors include the flagged cell (1,2) and several opened safe cells. With exactly one mine required around (2,3) and that mine already flagged, the remaining unopened neighbor(s) of (2,3) must be safe. In particular, (1,4) is an unopened neighbor of (2,3) and can be safely opened.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider the clues on (2,4) and (3,4). For (2,4)=2, its unknown neighbors are (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5), meaning exactly 2 mines lie among them. Meanwhile, (3,4)=1 has unknown neighbors (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5), so exactly 1 mine is among these. By subtracting the two conditions, we see that the cell (1,5) must be a mine (since 2 minus 1 yields 1 mine unaccounted for, and only (1,5) is exclusive to the (2,4) group). Therefore, (1,5) can be safely flagged as a mine.

REASONING: Focus on (2,4)=2 and (3,4)=1. For (2,4), its unknown neighbors are (2,5), (3,3), and (3,5) while it already has one flagged mine (at (1,5)), so exactly one mine must be among these three cells. Looking at (3,4)=1, its unknown neighbors are (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), and (4,5). Since (3,4) indicates one mine among these four and we know one comes from the shared triple in (2,4), cell (4,5) cannot be the mine. Therefore, (4,5) is safe to open.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We now have six unknown cells: (2,5), (3,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), and (5,5). Two mines remain to be found (given two flags are already in place). The clues (2,4)=2 and (3,4)=1 together tell us that exactly one mine lies between (2,5) and (3,5). Likewise, (4,1)=1 and (4,2)=1 force exactly one mine between (5,1) and (5,2). Finally, (4,4)=1 guarantees exactly one mine among (3,5), (5,4), and (5,5). Although options exist in overlapping groups, no cell is definitively safe by logic alone. In such ambiguous situations a guess becomes necessary. Uncovering (3,5) could provide valuable information that may help resolve adjacent 50/50 scenarios. Therefore, I will left-click (3,5) as the next move.

ACTION: L(3,5)
