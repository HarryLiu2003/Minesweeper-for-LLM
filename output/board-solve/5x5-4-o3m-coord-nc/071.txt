--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We are starting the game, so a logical first move is to click the center cell (3,3). Opening this cell minimizes risks since it often provides a broad view of the surrounding area, helping to infer the locations of the hidden mines.

REASONING: Looking at cell (3,4) which shows "2", its eight neighbors include only two unopened cells: (2,5) and (3,5). Since all other surrounding cells are opened and safe, these two must both contain mines. We can start by flagging one of them. Here, I choose to flag (2,5).

REASONING: Focusing on cell (3,4) which shows "2": its eight surrounding cells include one flagged mine at (2,5) and all others are opened except (3,5). Since the clue indicates two adjacent mines and one is already flagged, the remaining unopened neighbor (3,5) must be a mine. Thus, we can safely flag (3,5).

REASONING: Consider the cell at (4,4) which displays "1". Its neighbors are (3,3) (opened), (3,4) (opened), (3,5) flagged, (4,3) (opened), (4,5) (opened), (5,3) "?", (5,4) "?", and (5,5) "?". With one flagged mine already adjacent to (4,4), the remaining unknown neighbors must all be safe. Thus, we can safely left-click any of these unopened cells. I'll choose (5,3).

ACTION: L(5,3)

>> USER:
Your previous action "L(5,3)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').
Please follow the instructions and try again.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on the numbered cells in row 2, we see clues that involve only the row 1 cells. (2,1) requires one mine among (1,1) and (1,2). (2,2) requires one mine among (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). (2,3) requires one mine among (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). Finally, (2,4) indicates one mine among (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) because it already neighbors two flagged mines. Analyzing these clues reveals two possible mine placements: one possibility puts mines at (1,1) and (1,4); the other places mines at (1,2) and (1,5). In both cases (1,3) is safe. Therefore, we can confidently left-click cell (1,3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: At this stage, the only remaining unopened cells are in row 1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), and (1,5). Analyzing the constraints from neighboring numbers yields the following system. The clue at (1,3)=1 forces exactly one mine among (1,2) and (1,4). Meanwhile, the clue at (2,2)=1 and (2,1)=1 (with their only unopened neighbors being (1,1), (1,2), and (3,1) – with (3,1) open) imply that exactly one of (1,1) and (1,2) must be a mine. Also, (2,4)=3 (with two already flagged) forces exactly one mine among (1,4) and (1,5). These equations have two valid solutions: either the mines lie at (1,1) and (1,4) (making (1,2) and (1,5) safe) or they lie at (1,2) and (1,5) (making (1,1) and (1,4) safe). Thus, no cell is 100% safe, and we must choose a 50–50 guess. I will choose to left-click (1,2).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (1,2) which shows "1". Its neighbors include (1,1) which is unopened and (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) which are already revealed as numbers. Since a numbered cell implies that exactly that many mines exist among its adjacent unopened cells, and there is exactly one unopened neighbor (1,1), we deduce that (1,1) must contain a mine. Therefore, we flag cell (1,1).
