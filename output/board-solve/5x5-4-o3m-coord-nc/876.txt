--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: There is no revealed information yet, and as suggested we should start by exploring the center. Opening the central cell at (3,3) will maximize the potential of revealing multiple adjacent cells, giving us better clues to deduce safe moves for subsequent steps.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Consider the cell at (4,4), which shows "1". Its eight neighbors are: (3,3) ".", (3,4) "1", (3,5) "?", (4,3) ".", (4,5) "1", (5,3) ".", (5,4) ".", and (5,5) ".". All are revealed as safe except (3,5), which is still unopened. Since (4,4) indicates there is exactly one mine in its vicinity, it follows that (3,5) must contain a mine.

REASONING: Considering cell (2,4) which displays "1", its eight neighbors include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). Among these, (3,5) is flagged and (2,3), (3,3), and (3,4) are already revealed. Since (2,4) shows "1" and the single mine among its neighbors is flagged at (3,5), the remaining unopened cells — (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5) — are safe. We choose to uncover (1,3).

With one flagged neighbor at (3,5) already accounting for the mine, the remaining unopened neighbors — (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5) — must be safe. We choose to uncover (1,4).

REASONING: The cell at (1,3) shows "1" and its adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Aside from (1,2) which is still unopened, all other adjacent cells—(1,4) is blank and (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are numbered—are known to be safe. Since (1,3) indicates exactly one adjacent mine, the unrevealed (1,2) must be the mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let A = (1,1), B = (2,1), C = (3,1), and D = (4,1). From (2,2)=2, its eight neighbors include (1,1), (1,2)=F, (1,3)=1, (2,1), (2,3)=1, (3,1), (3,2)=2, and (3,3)=. Thus, A+B+C must equal 1 (one additional mine besides the flagged one). Meanwhile, (3,2)=2 has neighbors (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2)=2, and (4,3)=., so B+C+D must equal 2. Comparing the equations, we deduce A=0 (so (1,1) is safe) and D must be 1 (i.e., (4,1) is a mine), while exactly one mine is among B and C. Therefore, we can confidently flag (4,1) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: First, note that (5,2)=1 already has its adjacent mine identified at (4,1); thus, (4,3) and (5,3) must be safe. Next, analyze (3,2)=2. Its neighbors include (2,1), (3,1), and (4,3) (now safe) along with flagged (4,1), meaning exactly one mine exists among (2,1) and (3,1). Now, (2,2)=2 has neighbors (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) (with (1,2) already flagged) so one mine must be in these three. Since (2,1) and (3,1) already have exactly one mine between them, (1,1) must be safe. Additionally, (4,2)=2’s neighbors include (3,1) as the only unknown (all others are either flagged or safe), forcing (3,1) to be the mine. Consequently, (2,1) is safe. With (1,1) deduced safe, we can left-click it.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Observing (1,1)=1, its neighbors are (1,2)=F, (2,1)=?, and (2,2)=2. Since (1,1) already has one adjacent flagged mine at (1,2), (2,1) must be safe. Now, consider (2,2)=2, whose neighbors include (1,1)=1, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, and (3,3)=. With one mine confirmed at (1,2) and (2,1) determined safe, exactly one mine must be among the remaining unknowns (namely (3,1)). Thus, (3,1) is definitely a mine.
