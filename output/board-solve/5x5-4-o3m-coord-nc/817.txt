--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: To begin a Minesweeper game effectively, opening the center cell (3,3) offers the best chance of revealing helpful information. This central position is adjacent to many other cells and can potentially open a larger area if it turns out to be a blank or low-numbered cell, helping us deduce safe moves and locate mines later on.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,3) which shows "2", we identify its eight neighbors: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4). Among these, (1,3) is flagged and the rest are opened except (1,4), which remains unknown. Since the number "2" indicates exactly two mines in these adjacent cells and one has already been identified at (1,3), the cell (1,4) must also be a mine.

REASONING: Consider the cell (2,2) showing a "1". Its eight neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Out of these, (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), and (3,3) are open safe cells, and (1,3) is flagged. With (2,2) indicating exactly one mine which is already flagged adjacent to it, the only unopened neighbor (3,2) must be safe.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Inspect cell (4,4) with a "1" which neighbors (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) among others. It requires exactly one mine among these three unknowns. Meanwhile, cell (5,4) also showing "1" has two unknown neighbors: (4,5) and (5,5). Both cells together force that exactly one mine must be among (4,5) and (5,5), leaving (3,5) as safe. Therefore, (3,5) can be safely left-clicked.

REASONING: Notice that cell (4,2) is a blank cell (".") which means it has 0 mines in its eight neighboring cells. Its neighbors include (4,3) and (5,3), which remain unopened. Since a blank cell guarantees that all adjacent cells are safe, we can safely left-click one of these unopened cells. Here, we choose (4,3).

REASONING:

REASONING: All remaining unknown cells—(1,5), (2,5), (4,5), and (5,5)—are part of interdependent constraints. Analysis of (2,4)=3, (3,4)=1, and (4,4)=1 yields two possible configurations among these four cells, each with 50% probability of being a mine. No cell is logically guaranteed safe based on current information. With no safe move deduced, a guess is required. I will choose to left-click (1,5) as my next move.

Since the total mines around (1,5) must equal 2, and one mine is already flagged at (1,4), the remaining mine must be at (2,5). Therefore, (2,5) should be flagged.
