--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since all cells are currently unopened, we want to reveal as much information as possible by starting at the center. The center cell (3,3) is a strategic position that maximizes the likelihood of opening adjacent cells automatically if it turns out to be blank. This will help us gather clues about the mine positions right from the start.

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (1,2) shows a "1" with neighbors (1,1), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), and (2,3). With (1,3) and (2,3) open, the mine must lie among (1,1) and (2,1). Also, (2,2) is "1" with unknown neighbors (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1); since only one mine is adjacent here and the mine from (1,2) is shared between (1,1) and (2,1), (3,1) must be safe. Furthermore, (3,2) shows a "2" and its unknown neighbors are (2,1) and (4,1). To satisfy the "2" on (3,2), both must be mines. Thus, (2,1) is confirmed as a mine.

ACTION:

REASONING: Examining cell (2,2) which displays "1", its neighbors include (1,1), (2,3), (3,1) (all unknown) and (2,1) is flagged. Since the "1" is already accounted for by the flagged cell (2,1), the remaining unknown neighbors must be safe to open.

REASONING: The cell at (2,2) shows "1" and already has one flagged mine adjacent at (2,1). Its only unknown neighbor is (3,1), meaning it cannot be a mine. Therefore, it is safe to left-click (3,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at the cell (3,1) which displays "2", its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). Among these, (2,1) is flagged (F) and (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) are already revealed and safe. That leaves (4,1) as the only unknown neighbor. Since (3,1) requires 2 mines in total and one is already flagged, (4,1) must contain the second mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (4,2) which shows "3", its eight neighbors are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Among these, (4,1) is flagged, so one mine is already marked. The remaining unknown cells in this group are (5,1) and (5,2) – and they are the only ones that can account for the additional two mines required by the "3" at (4,2). Therefore, both (5,1) and (5,2) must be mines. We now flag one of them.

With two mines already flagged among its neighbors (at (4,1) and (5,1)), there must be one more mine to satisfy the count of 3. The only remaining covered cell is (5,2), so it must be a mine.
