--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Starting the game with a non-biased approach, the center cell (3,3) is the optimal candidate as it maximizes the potential information gain from its eight neighbors. Revealing this cell may provide clues to safely deduce the positions of nearby mines. It serves as a strong opening move because once it is revealed, its number or blank state will guide subsequent decisions. 

ACTION: L(3,3)

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (2,4) which displays "1", we note that its eight neighbors include exactly one unopened cell: (3,5). All other surrounding cells are already revealed (either blank or numbered). Since (2,4) must have exactly one mine adjacent and no mines have been flagged around it yet, it follows that (3,5) must be a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag cell (3,5).

REASONING: Looking at cell (3,4), it displays "1". Its neighbors are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Among these, (3,5) is flagged and all others except (4,5) have already been opened. Since the flagged count around (3,4) equals its number (1), we can deduce that the remaining neighbor, (4,5), is safe to open. The reliable deduction allows us to use a middle-click on (3,4) to automatically expose (4,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on the cluster of unknown cells adjacent to the numbered cells at (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2), we examine their shared unknown neighbors. For (1,2), its unknown neighbors are (1,1) and (2,1) (since (1,3) and (2,3) are opened). For (2,2), the unknown neighbors are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1). For (3,2), the unknown neighbors are (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1). Setting a variable for each unknown mine possibility, we find that in order to satisfy these cells—which each indicate exactly one mine among their neighbors—the cell (3,1) must be safe. This is because the equations force the mine count at (3,1) to zero.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Considering cell (3,1) with "1", its neighbors include the unknown cells (2,1) and (4,1). These two must contain exactly one mine. Now, cell (3,2) also displaying "1" has three unknown neighbors: (2,1), (3,3), and (4,1). Since (2,1) and (4,1) already collectively have one mine (from (3,1)), (3,3) cannot be a mine and is therefore safe to reveal.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: After analyzing the board, the information from the numbered cells leads to two equally possible configurations for the unknown cells in the top block; thus no move there is 100% safe. However, examining the lower portion of the board, particularly around cell (4,4) which shows “2,” we note its unknown neighbors are (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5) with exactly one mine among them. This implies that each of these cells has a lower mine probability (about 1⁄3) compared to the roughly 50% chance in the upper area. With no logically forced safe move available, the best risk–minimizing choice is to uncover one of these lower cells. I choose (5,4) for a left-click.
