--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: At the start of the game, we have no numerical clues and must make an opening move. The instruction specifies that we begin by left-clicking the center cell at (3,3). This is a common strategy as it maximizes the chance of opening multiple safe cells and providing useful information for subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Examining the numbered cells on the board, (4,4) shows “1” with its unknown neighbors being (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Similarly, (4,5) shows “1” with its unknown neighbors being (5,4) and (5,5). For (4,5) to be satisfied, exactly one mine must be among (5,4) and (5,5), which means that (5,3) cannot be a mine; otherwise, (4,4)’s count would exceed one. Therefore, we can safely left-click (5,3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Look at (1,2) which shows “1” and has only two unknown neighbors: (1,1) and (2,1). This means exactly one of these must be a mine. Now, (2,2) displays “2” and its unknown neighbors are (1,1), (2,1) and (3,1). Since (1,1) and (2,1) already contribute one mine by (1,2)’s count, the remaining mine must be at (3,1). Thus, (3,1) is deduced to be a mine and should be flagged.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We note the board has three distinct groups of unknown cells dictated by the numbered constraints. Group 1 – {(1,1), (2,1)} – must include exactly one mine (as seen by (1,2)=1), giving each a 50% chance of being a mine. Group 3 – {(5,4), (5,5)} – also has exactly one mine (from both (4,4) and (4,5)=1), so each is 50% risky. Group 2 – {(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)} – is constrained by (4,2)=2; however, an additional constraint from (3,2)=2 forces exactly one mine between (2,1) and (4,1). This makes (4,1) conditionally riskier (around a 50% mine chance), while (5,1) and (5,2) are safer – each roughly having a 25% chance to be a mine. Thus, to maximize our chance of not hitting a mine, a logical move is to left-click on one of the safer Group 2 cells. I choose cell (5,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We now face an ambiguous situation. The unknown cells are all linked by the following clues: (1,2) “1” forces exactly one mine between (1,1) and (2,1), and (3,2) “2” with its neighbors (2,1) and (4,1) forces exactly one mine between these two. Likewise, (5,1) “1” implies one mine between (4,1) and (5,2); (5,3) “1” forces one mine between (5,2) and (5,4); and (4,5) “1” (as well as (4,4) “1”) requires exactly one mine between (5,4) and (5,5). Combining these constraints introduces two equally valid possibilities in which each unknown cell is a mine in one possibility and safe in the other. In such 50/50 scenarios, we must guess. I choose to left-click (1,1), because if it is safe it will likely open up adjacent cells and provide additional clues.

ACTION: L(1,1)
