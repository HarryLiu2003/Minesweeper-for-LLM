--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the game is just beginning and every cell is unopened, we follow the given instruction to start by left-clicking the center cell at (3,3) to reveal it. This move is safe and provides information about the mine distribution for subsequent moves.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (4,3), which displays a “1”, we examine its eight neighbors. All of its adjacent cells have been revealed except for (5,2). Since (4,3)’s number “1” indicates there is exactly one mine among its neighbors and (5,2) is the only unopened cell among them, it must contain a mine. Thus, we can confidently flag (5,2).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,2) displays “1” and its eight neighbors include (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1) as unopened, along with (5,2) already flagged. Since (4,2)’s number equals the count of its flagged neighbor (1 flagged out of 1 mine indicated), the remaining unopened neighbors must be safe. Thus, we can safely open (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1) by middle-clicking on (4,2).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (3,1) which shows “1”, its adjacent neighbors include (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). Except for (2,1), all other neighboring cells are already opened and confirmed safe. With “1” mine indicated around (3,1), the only remaining unknown neighbor, (2,1), must be where the mine is located. Therefore, it is safe to flag (2,1).

REASONING: Examining the cell at (5,3) which displays “1”, its adjacent neighbors are (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=?; (5,2)=F (flagged) and (5,4)=?. Since it shows “1” and already one adjacent cell has been flagged, the remaining unopened neighbors ((4,4) and (5,4)) must be safe. Thus, we can safely reveal them by middle-clicking on (5,3).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (5,3) which displays “1”. Its eight neighbors are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4) (and cells outside the grid are ignored). With (5,2) already flagged, the flagged count equals the number “1” shown on (5,3). This means the remaining unopened neighbors of (5,3)—namely (4,4) and (5,4)—are guaranteed to be safe. We can therefore confidently left-click on one of them. I'll choose cell (4,4) for our next move.

ACTION: L(4,4)

>> USER:
Your previous action "L(4,4)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The unknown cells in row1 are involved in the clues from row2. Labeling (1,1)=x, (1,2)=y, (1,3)=z, (1,4)=w, and (1,5)=v, we observe from cell (2,2)=2 (with neighbor (2,1) flagged) that x + y + z must equal 1. From (2,3)=1, we have y + z + w = 1, and from (2,4)=1, z + w + v = 1, with (2,5)=1 forcing w + v = 1. Combining these, we deduce z must equal 0, meaning (1,3) is mine-free. Therefore, it is safe to left-click cell (1,3).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We have narrowed the unknown cells to (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), and (1,5) with these constraints:
 • (1,1)+(1,2)=1 (from (2,2)=2 with one flagged neighbor)
 • (1,2)+(1,4)=1 (from (1,3)=1)
 • (1,4)+(1,5)=1 (from (2,4)=1 and (2,5)=1)
These yield two symmetric possibilities: either (1,1) and (1,4) contain mines (with (1,2) and (1,5) safe) or (1,2) and (1,5) are mines (with (1,1) and (1,4) safe). No cell is guaranteed safe in both cases. Thus, a guess is necessary. I will choose to left-click (1,1) hoping for the best outcome.

ACTION: L(1,1)
