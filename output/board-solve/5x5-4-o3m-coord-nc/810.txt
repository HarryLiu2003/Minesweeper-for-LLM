--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since we are beginning the game and every cell is currently unopened, it's best to start with the center cell to maximize the potential information gained. The center cell (3,3) touches the most adjacent cells, so revealing it may uncover a large safe area or provide key numbers to guide our subsequent moves.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: From the revealed numbers we deduced the following: (2,5)=2 indicates both (1,4) and (1,5) must be mines. Using (2,3)=1 and knowing (1,4) is a mine, (1,2) and (1,3) are safe. Focusing on the trio around (3,2)=1, its unknown neighbors are (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1) with exactly one mine among them. Similarly, (4,2)=1 and (5,2)=1 narrow down the possible mine among (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1) and then between (4,1) and (5,1) respectively. The consistent scenario is that (4,1) is the mine here, which in turn forces (2,1) and (3,1) to be safe. Finally, (2,2)=1 then forces (1,1) to be the remaining mine among its unknown neighbors. With 4 mines total, we deduce mine positions at (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), and (4,1). A safe next step is to mark one of these deduced mines.

REASONING: Consider the cell at (1,2) which is marked with a 1. Its adjacent cells include (1,1) (already flagged), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). With (1,1) supplying the single required mine, the remaining adjacent unknown cells—specifically (1,3) and (2,1)—must be safe. Therefore, it's safe to left-click (1,3).

REASONING: Looking at (1,3) which shows a 1, we identify its adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Out of these, (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4) are already revealed and are not mines. Since (1,3) must have one mine adjacent to it, the only remaining candidate is (1,4). Therefore, (1,4) must be a mine.

So exactly one mine is among (4,1) and (4,3). Next, observe (4,2)=1. Its unknown neighbors are (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), and (5,3). Likewise, (5,2)=1 has unknown neighbors (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), and (5,3). Together, these require that exactly one mine appears in the intersection (4,1) and (4,3) (from (3,2)=1) and then no additional mines can be among (5,1) and (5,3). Therefore, (5,1) must be safe.

REASONING: Looking at (3,1)=1, its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). With (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), and (4,2) already showing numbers and assumed safe, (4,1) must be the lone mine adjacent to (3,1). This conclusion also fits the constraints from (4,2)=1 and (5,2)=1, which share (4,1) among their unknown neighbors. Thus, we confidently deduce that (4,1) contains a mine.
