--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: As the board is entirely unopened, the optimal starting strategy is to reveal the center cell. The instruction specifies to initiate the game by left-clicking on (3,3). Since there is no further information to infer any mines, this move is safe and aligns with our initial move strategy.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Looking at (5,2), which displays the number 1, we note its neighbors: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), and (5,3). Among these, (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (5,1) are already opened and confirmed safe. This leaves (5,3) as the sole covered neighbor. Since (5,2) must have exactly one adjacent mine, it logically follows that (5,3) is a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining cell (4,4) which displays the number 1 reveals its eight neighbors: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Notably, among these, (5,3) is flagged, which satisfies the mine count for (4,4). Thus, the remaining unopened cells (4,5) and (5,5) around it are safe to reveal. We can confidently middle-click on (4,4) to automatically open these safe neighboring cells.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (2,1) which shows a 2, its eight neighbors include (1,1) and (1,2) that are still unopened, while the remaining neighbors are safely opened. Since (2,1) must have exactly two adjacent mines and the only covered cells around it are (1,1) and (1,2), both must be mines. We can flag one of these mine candidates now; here, we'll flag (1,1).

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,1), which displays the number 2, we examine its neighbors. They are (1,1) [already flagged], (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). With one mine flagged (at 1,1) and one remaining covered neighbor (1,2), the mine count of 2 mandates that (1,2) is a mine.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,2) which shows a 2, we check its neighbors: they include (1,1) and (1,2) which are flagged, and (1,3) which is still unopened. Since (2,2) requires exactly 2 mines and both are already flagged, all other adjacent cells must be safe. Therefore, we can safely clear (1,3) along with any other unopened neighbors by performing a middle-click on (2,2).

Among these, all are revealed and safe except (1,5), which is still covered. Since (2,4) already has no adjacent flag and requires one mine, we deduce (1,5) must be a mine.
