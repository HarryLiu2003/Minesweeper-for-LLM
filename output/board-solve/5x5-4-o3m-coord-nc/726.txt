--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: To begin the Minesweeper game and gather initial information to help deduce mine positions, it is best to start by opening a central cell. Opening the center cell at (3,3) allows us to potentially reveal a blank or a number that provides clues about surrounding mines. By choosing (3,3), we maximize the chance of exposing several safe cells through auto-reveal if it is blank. This move is a common opening choice and gives a balanced view of the board, aiding further strategies.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: The cell at (3,1) displays a "1". Its neighboring cells include (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). All of these, except (4,1), have been opened as safe cells. Because (3,1) requires exactly one adjacent mine, the only possibility is that (4,1) is a mine. We can therefore flag (4,1) with a right-click.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (3,2) which displays "1". Its eight neighbors include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) from row 2, (3,1) already open, (3,3) open, and (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) from row 4. Out of those, (4,1) is flagged and all others are either opened or unknown except (2,3). Since the mine count (1) for (3,2) is already met by the flagged (4,1), the remaining covered cell (2,3) must be safe. Thus, we can safely left-click (2,3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Reconsidering cell (3,2) which shows "1", we see its flagged neighbor (4,1) already accounts for the single mine indicated. Its other covered neighbors—(2,3) and (3,3)—are therefore safe to open. Instead of a left-click (which caused an error previously), we can use the middle-click on (3,2) to automatically reveal all its adjacent covered cells.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (3,2) with value 1, its eight neighbors are {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)}. Out of these, (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), and (4,3) are already revealed and safe, and (4,1) is flagged as a mine. That leaves only (2,3) as the still-covered neighbor. Since the mine count of 1 is completely accounted for by the flagged cell (4,1), the remaining covered cell (2,3) cannot possibly hide a mine. Therefore, it is safe to reveal the cell at (2,3) using a left-click.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Reassessing the situation, we note that the cell at (3,2) shows a "1" with one flagged neighbor at (4,1). All revealed neighbors around (3,2) are safe, leaving its two covered neighbors – (2,3) and (3,3) – as mine‐free. Previously, our attempt to left-click (2,3) was rejected by the system (indicating its blank status). Therefore, we can instead safely left-click the other covered, safe neighbor at (3,3).

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let’s analyze the clues from the top rows. For cell (1,4) = 1, its unknown neighbors are (1,5) and (2,5) (since (1,3), (2,3) and (2,4) are already revealed). This tells us exactly one mine exists among (1,5) and (2,5). Meanwhile, cell (2,4) = 2 has three unknown neighbors: (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5). No flags are adjacent to (2,4) yet. Since (1,4) guarantees at most one mine between (1,5) and (2,5), the count for (2,4) forces (3,5) to be a mine to reach a total of two mines. Thus, we can safely flag (3,5) as a mine.
