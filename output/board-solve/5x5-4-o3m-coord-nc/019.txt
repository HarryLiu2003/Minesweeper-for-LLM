--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since no moves have been made, the board is completely undiscovered. A common tactical approach in Minesweeper is to start at the center of the board, as it offers maximum potential to reveal adjacent cells and gather useful information for subsequent moves. Therefore, we begin by left-clicking the center cell located at (3,3).

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Examining cell (3,1), which displays a "1", we note its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). Among these, (2,2) is a numbered cell and (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2) are opened blanks or numbers, leaving only (2,1) unopened. Since (3,1) shows exactly one mine among its neighbors, (2,1) must be the mine. Therefore, we can flag it confidently.

All of these are already opened except (3,5), which remains unknown. Since a "1" indicates exactly one mine among its neighbors and none have been flagged around (4,4) yet, (3,5) must contain the mine.

REASONING: Looking at cell (3,1) which displays a "1", we note its adjacent cells: (2,1) is flagged as a mine and the remaining adjacent cells (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2) have already been revealed as safe except for (4,1) and (4,2) which are still unopened. Because (3,1)â€™s "1" is already accounted for by the flag at (2,1), the other unopened neighbors must be safe. Consequently, we can confidently clear one of these safe cells. Choosing (4,1) as a candidate, we can left-click it.

REASONING: Consider cell (3,1), which displays a "1". Its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2). Out of these, (2,1) is flagged, (2,2) and (3,2) are numbered, and (4,1) is already opened as a blank. This accounts for the single mine indicated by the "1". Therefore, the remaining unopened neighbor (4,2) must be safe. We can confidently clear cell (4,2) with a left-click.

REASONING: Letâ€™s denote the unknown row1 cells as follows:
A = (1,1), B = (1,2), C = (1,3), D = (1,4), and E = (1,5).  
Analyzing neighbors:
â€¢ (2,2)=2 sees F at (2,1) and needs exactly one mine among A, B, C â†’ A+B+C = 1.  
â€¢ (2,3)=1 needs one mine among B, C, D â†’ B+C+D = 1.  
â€¢ (2,4)=2 sees F at (3,5) and needs one mine among C, D, E â†’ C+D+E = 1.  
â€¢ (2,5)=2 sees F at (3,5) and needs one mine among D, E â†’ D+E = 1.  

From (2,4) and (2,5): Since D+E = 1, then C+D+E = C+1 must equal 1, implying C = 0 (safe).  
Thus, cell (1,3) is safe.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Our deductions on rowÂ 1 yield two consistent configurationsâ€”one where (1,1) is safe and (1,2) is a mine, and the other where (1,1) is a mine and (1,2) is safe. Similarly, (1,4) and (1,5) swap roles between safe and mine. This ambiguity means none of the unopened rowÂ 1 cells can be proven safe by logic alone. Thus, we must make a guess. I choose to left-click (1,1) as an arbitrary guess, accepting the inherent 50% risk.
