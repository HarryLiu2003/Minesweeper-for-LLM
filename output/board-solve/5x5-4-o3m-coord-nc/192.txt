--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Every cell on the board is currently unopened ("?"). To begin, following the instructions provided, we must start by left-clicking the center cell. The center cell, (3,3), is a strategic position that will likely give valuable insight into the surrounding cells, opening up opportunities for further logical deductions. By revealing this cell, we can gather information about the distribution of nearby mines, helping us to plan subsequent moves cautiously and effectively.

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (2,1), which shows "1", we notice its neighbors include (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). All neighbors except (3,1) are opened and confirmed safe. Thus, the only candidate to be a mine is (3,1). To satisfy the count "1" at (2,1), the cell (3,1) must contain a mine. This makes flagging (3,1) our logical next move.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (1,4), which shows “2”. Its neighbors are (1,3): safe (opened dot), (1,5): unopened, (2,3): safe (opened dot), (2,4): safe (number “2”), and (2,5): unopened. With exactly two unknown cells, (1,5) and (2,5) must each hide a mine to satisfy the “2”. Thus, we can confidently mark one of these cells as a mine. I'll flag cell (1,5).

REASONING:

REASONING: Examining cell (1,4) which displays “2”, we see its neighbors are (1,3): opened (.), (1,5): flagged (F), (2,3): opened (.), (2,4): opened (2), and (2,5): unopened (“?”). With one mine already marked at (1,5) and the “2” value indicating two adjacent mines, the only possibility is that (2,5) must also be a mine. Hence, we should flag (2,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,4) which shows “2”, we note its neighboring cells include (1,5) and (2,5) flagged as mines. Since the number “2” matches the count of flagged mines, all other adjacent unopened cells must be safe to reveal. Among these, (2,3) and (3,3) are still unopened. We can automatically open these cells by middle-clicking (2,4).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,2) which shows “1”, its eight neighbors include two unopened cells: (2,3) and (3,3), with one adjacent flagged mine already at (3,1). Since the count of flagged mines equals the number displayed, the remaining unknown neighbors must be safe. Thus, (2,3) is safe to open.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (5,3) which displays “1”, note its neighbors: (4,2)=2, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=., (5,2)=?, and (5,4)=. Since all its open neighbors are safe, the only candidate that can satisfy the “1” is the unopened cell (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) must contain the remaining mine.
