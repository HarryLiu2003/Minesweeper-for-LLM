--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Starting the game requires us to reveal a cell to gain valuable information. The center cell at (3,3) is an optimal choice as specified, since it maximizes the chance of opening multiple adjacent cells and exposing numbers or blanks. By clicking the center, we aim to unfold a larger portion of the board, which can then be used to deduce where the mines might be. This opening move is both strategic and in line with the initial instructions.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Looking at the cell at (1,3) which displays a "1", we examine its adjacent cells. Its neighbors include (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Among these, (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4) are already revealed (either as blank or numbered), leaving only (1,2) unopened. Since (1,3)'s "1" indicates exactly one mine in its surrounding cells, the mine must be located at (1,2).

REASONING: Analyzing cell (2,1) which displays "1", its neighbors include (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). Among these, (1,2) is flagged, matching the required mine count. This confirms that the remaining neighbor, (1,1), must be safe to open. Therefore, we can reveal (1,1) with a left-click.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining cell (2,1) which displays "1" shows that its neighbors include (1,1):1, (1,2):F, (2,2):1, (3,1):? and (3,2):?. With one flag placed at (1,2), the mine count is satisfied. This implies that the remaining unknown neighbors, (3,1) and (3,2), are safe. We can safely left-click one of these cells—I'll choose (3,1).

REASONING: Consider cell (2,3), which displays the number "1". Its eight neighbors include one flagged cell at (1,2) and all others are already revealed except for (3,3). Since the flagged count equals the number on (2,3), we can safely reveal the remaining unopened neighbor. Thus, using a middle-click on (2,3) will safely uncover cell (3,3).

REASONING: Analyzing cell (4,2) which shows "1", we note its neighbors among row 5 are (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Simultaneously, cell (4,1) with a "1" has unknown neighbors (5,1) and (5,2). For (4,1) to be satisfied, exactly one mine must exist between (5,1) and (5,2). This implies that in the trio for (4,2) (i.e. (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)), the mine is already committed to either (5,1) or (5,2), forcing (5,3) to be safe.

With one flag already in place at (4,5) satisfying its "1", we can safely presume that any other unopened adjacent cell—in this case, (3,3)—is free of mines.
