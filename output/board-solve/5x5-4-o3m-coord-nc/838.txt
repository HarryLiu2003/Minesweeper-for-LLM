--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: No information is available on the board since all cells are unopened. To kick off the game with a strategic move, we'll follow the instruction given and reveal the center cell, which is (3,3). This move will provide us with some numbers or a blank, allowing us to deduce further moves effectively.

REASONING: Consider the cell at (2,2) which displays a “1”. Its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Among these, (3,1) is flagged (F) and all the others are open except (2,3) and (3,3). Since (2,2) already accounts for one mine via (3,1), the remaining unopened neighbors (2,3) and (3,3) must be safe. We can therefore safely left-click on (2,3).

REASONING: Examining cell (2,2) which shows a “1”, we note its eight neighbors. Among these, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,2) are opened, and (3,1) is already flagged. The remaining unopened neighbors are (2,3) and (3,3). Since the flagged count already matches the 1 displayed on (2,2), we know that the unopened neighbors must be safe. Thus, we can safely open them by middle-clicking (2,2).

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,2) which shows a “1,” we identify its eight neighbors: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Among these, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,2) are opened, and (3,1) is flagged as a mine. This correctly accounts for the single mine indicated by cell (2,2). Therefore, the remaining unopened neighbors, (2,3) and (3,3), must be safe. To reveal both simultaneously, we can perform a middle-click on (2,2).

REASONING: Based on cell (2,2)’s number “1,” its neighbors include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). With (3,1) already flagged as a mine and the rest opened (or in the process of being cleared), both (2,3) and (3,3) must be safe. Since our earlier attempt to reveal (2,3) was invalid, we will now safely left-click on (3,3).
