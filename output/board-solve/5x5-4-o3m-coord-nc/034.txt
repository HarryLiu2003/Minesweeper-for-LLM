--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The game begins with an entirely unopened board. As instructed, the safest and typical starting move in Minesweeper is to open the center cell to potentially maximize the number of adjacent cells that reveal information. Therefore, I will left-click the center cell at (3,3) as our first move.

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining (4,1) which shows "1", its neighbors are (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1) and (5,2). Of these, (3,2), (5,1), and (5,2) are already opened, leaving only (3,1) as an unopened cell. Since the "1" on (4,1) indicates there is exactly one mine in its surrounding, (3,1) must contain the mine. Therefore, the next move is to flag (3,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (4,1), which shows the number "1", we see its neighbors include (3,1): F, (3,2): 1, (4,2): 1, (5,1): ? and (5,2): ?. Since (4,1) already has one flagged neighbor matching its number, the remaining unopened neighbors (5,1) and (5,2) cannot be mines. Therefore, it is safe to left-click one of these cells. I will choose (5,1).

ACTION: L(5,1)

>> USER:
Your previous action "L(5,1)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').
Please follow the instructions and try again.

REASONING: Reviewing cell (3,2) which shows a "1", its 8 neighbors include one flagged cell at (3,1) and only one unopened neighbor: (2,1) (all others are opened). Since the flag already meets the count required by (3,2), the remaining unopened neighbor (2,1) must be safe. I will left-click (2,1).

REASONING: Focusing on (2,3)=1, its neighbors are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4). Weâ€™ve deduced earlier from (2,2)=3 (with (3,1) flagged) that among its unknown neighbors (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) there must be exactly 2 mines. Also, from (2,1)=2, with one flag already adjacent (3,1), exactly one mine exists between (1,1) and (1,2). This forces (1,3) to be a mine and (1,2) is safe (since if (1,2) were a mine then (1,1) would be safe, but then (2,3)=1 would have only (1,3) as a mine, and similar reasoning puts (1,4) as safe). Consequently, (1,4) is deduced to be safe. I will left-click (1,4).

REASONING: Focusing on (2,2)=3, its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Already, (3,1) is flagged and (3,3) is blank. Thus, 2 mines are required among (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Meanwhile, (2,1)=2 indicates that, with the flagged neighbor (3,1), exactly one mine exists among (1,1) and (1,2). Therefore, the remaining mine needed for (2,2)=3 must be at (1,3). I will flag (1,3) as a mine.

REASONING: Consider cell (1,4) showing "2". Its neighbors are (1,3): F, (1,5): ?, (2,3): 1, (2,4): 2, and (2,5): 1. Since one mine is already flagged at (1,3), the remaining mine must lie in one of the unknown neighbors. Here, (1,5) is the only unopened neighbor. Thus, (1,5) must be a mine and should be flagged.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,1)=2, its neighbors are (1,1): ?, (1,2): 2, (2,2): 3, (3,1): F, and (3,2): 1.

Therefore, (1,1) must be a mine, and we can safely flag it.
