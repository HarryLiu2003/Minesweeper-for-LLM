--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since we are at the start of the game with an entirely unopened board, revealing the center cell (3,3) is a common strategy. This move maximizes the number of neighboring cells that could be automatically exposed if the cell is blank, providing critical information for future deductions. Hence, we begin with a left-click on (3,3) as advised.

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on (3,4), which displays a "1", we examine its neighbors. They are: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=?; (3,3)=. , (3,5)=1; (4,3)=. , (4,4)=. , (4,5)=. Among them, every other neighbor is already opened (as a number or blank) except for (2,5). Since (3,4) requires exactly one adjacent mine and only (2,5) remains unopened, it must be the mine. Thus, we flag it.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at (2,4) which shows “2” and has three unknown neighbors—(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)—and one flagged (2,5), we know exactly 2 mines must be among its unknown neighbors. Meanwhile, (2,3) displays “1” and touches unknown neighbors (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). They share (1,3) and (1,4) as common neighbors. For (2,3) to have exactly one mine among its three unknowns, it’s most consistent that the shared pair (1,3) and (1,4) contains exactly one mine, which forces (1,2) to be safe. Then, to satisfy (2,4)’s count of 2, (1,5) must be the additional mine. Thus, we can confidently flag cell (1,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (2,4) which shows “2”, we note its eight neighbors include (1,5) and (2,5) already flagged. This satisfies its mine count, meaning its remaining neighbors (including (1,3) and (1,4)) are safe. Now consider (2,3) which shows “1”. Its neighbors are (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). Since we now deduce (1,3) and (1,4) must be safe (as derived from (2,4)’s count), the only possibility to fulfill (2,3)’s requirement is that (1,2) must contain the single mine. Thus, we flag (1,2).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,3) with a value of "1", its neighbors include (1,2) which is already flagged. Since its count is completely accounted for by that flag, all other neighboring unopened cells must be safe. In particular, cells (1,3) and (1,4) are safe to open. I'll choose to uncover (1,3) next with a left-click.
