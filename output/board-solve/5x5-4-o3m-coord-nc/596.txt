--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: To break the initial symmetry and gather useful information, we follow the instruction to start by revealing the center cell at (3,3). This move is standard and optimal, as it maximizes the potential of uncovering multiple cells and helps deduce safe moves for subsequent actions.

ACTION: L(3,3)

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,4) which shows "1", we observe its eight neighbors. Seven are already opened, leaving only (3,5) still unopened. Since (2,4) requires exactly one mine around it and no flags are present, the only possibility is that (3,5) must contain a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (3,5).

REASONING: Inspect cell (3,4) which displays a "1". Its eight neighbors are: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Among these, (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), and (4,4) are already opened and (3,5) is flagged. Thus, the lone remaining neighbor (4,5) must be safe because the one mine required by the "1" has already been flagged. Therefore, we can safely left-click cell (4,5).

Among these, (3,5) is flagged and the others are opened except for (5,5). With one mine already identified in its neighborhood, the remaining mine must be at (5,5). Thus, we can safely flag (5,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Analyzing cell (5,2)=1, its neighbors include (4,1) and (5,1) as the only unopened candidates, meaning exactly one of them is a mine. Meanwhile, cell (4,2)=1 has three unopened neighbors: (3,1), (4,1), and (5,1). For (4,2)=1 to hold true along with (5,2)=1, (3,1) cannot be a mine; otherwise, (4,1) and (5,1) would both have to be safe, contradicting (5,2)=1. Thus, (3,1) must be safe, making it eligible for a left-click.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: After reviewing the constraints, we see that the remaining unopened cells form two ambiguous pairs. Specifically, (1,2) and (2,2) tell us exactly one mine lies in the pair (1,1) and (2,1). Meanwhile, (4,2) and (5,2) indicate that exactly one mine is in the pair (4,1) and (5,1). In addition, (3,1)’s “1” forces exactly one mine among (2,1) and (4,1). These relationships produce two equally plausible mine distributions with no cell that is safe in every scenario. Consequently, we must make a guess. I choose to left-click (2,1) as the next move, hoping it reveals helpful information.

With one flagged neighbor already present, (2,2)'s mine count is satisfied. This means that every other adjacent unopened cell must be safe. Thus both (2,3) and (3,3) have no mine.
