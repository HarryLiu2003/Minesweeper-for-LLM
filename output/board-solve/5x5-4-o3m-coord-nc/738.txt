--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since no cell has yet been revealed, our best initial strategy is to reveal a central cell that provides maximum exposure to surrounding cells. In many Minesweeper strategies, clicking the center offers a good chance to open up a larger area without immediately encountering a mine. Therefore, as instructed, we begin by left-clicking the center cell at (3,3).

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on the lower right area, examine (3,4)=1 whose unopened neighbors are (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5). This means exactly 1 of these cells is a mine. Now, checking (4,4)=2, we see its unopened neighbors (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) must sum to 2 mines. Furthermore, (5,4)=1 has only (4,5) and (5,5) as its unopened neighbors, implying exactly one mine among them. Testing the only possibility that satisfies all three constraints—by setting (4,5) safe and (5,5) as a mine—we find (3,5) must be the mine in (4,4)’s region because 1 (from (3,5)) + 0 (from (4,5)) + 1 (from (5,5)) = 2, and then (3,4)’s region becomes (2,5)=safe, (3,5)=mine, and (4,5)=safe. Therefore, we deduce that (3,5) is a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining cell (3,4) which displays "1", we note its eight neighbors include (3,5) which is flagged as a mine. Since the count of flagged neighbors equals the number on (3,4), all other adjacent unopened cells must be safe. Among these safe cells are (2,5), (4,3), and (4,5). Thus, by a middle-click action on (3,4), we can safely open these neighbors.

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,5) which displays "1", its neighbors are (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (3,4), and (3,5). Notably, (3,5) is flagged as a mine, meaning the number on (2,5) is fully accounted for by the flagged mine. Since the number of flagged neighbors equals the number on the cell, the remaining unopened neighbors—(1,4) and (1,5)—must be safe. Using a middle-click on (2,5) will automatically reveal these safe cells.

REASONING: The cell at (1,4) displays a "1" and its neighbors include (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). Among these, (1,5) is opened (.) and the others are already revealed with numbers. Therefore, (1,3) remains the only unopened neighbor, meaning it must contain the single mine adjacent to (1,4). Accordingly, we can flag (1,3) as a mine.

REASONING: Examine cell (2,2), which shows "1". Its eight neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Among these, (1,3) is flagged as a mine, satisfying the "1" requirement. Therefore, the remaining unopened cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,1) are guaranteed safe. We can confidently left-click one of these safe cells. Here, we'll choose (1,1).
