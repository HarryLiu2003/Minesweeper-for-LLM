--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the board is entirely unopened, making a first click at the center is a common strategy. The center cell (3,3) is chosen because it touches the maximum number of neighboring cells, providing the best chance to reveal useful information. Therefore, as instructed, we will left-click (3,3) to begin the game.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Let’s consider (1,4) which displays 1. Its only unknown neighbors are (1,5) and (2,5), meaning exactly 1 mine is among them. Now, (2,4) shows 2 and its unknown neighbors are (1,5), (2,5), and (3,5). Since (1,4) already ensures one mine exists in (1,5) or (2,5), the remaining mine indicated by (2,4) must lie at (3,5). Consequently, we can be confident that (3,5) is mined and should be flagged.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at (4,1)=1, its unknown neighbors include (5,1) and (5,2). Thus exactly one of these contains a mine. Meanwhile, (4,2)=2 has three unknown neighbors: (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Since (4,2) already sees two mines around it and (4,1) confirms one mine must be in (5,1) or (5,2), the remaining mine must necessarily be at (5,3). Therefore, we can safely flag (5,3).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at (4,3)=1, its neighbors are (5,2), (5,3)=F, and (5,4). Since one flagged mine is already found at (5,3), both (5,2) and (5,4) must be safe. Next, (4,1)=1 has only (5,1) and (5,2) as unknown neighbors; with (5,2) deduced safe, (5,1) must be a mine. Therefore, we flag (5,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider the cell at (4,2) that displays a 2. Its adjacent neighbors include two flagged mines already at (5,1) and (5,3). Since (4,2) already accounts for its two mines, every other adjacent unknown cell must be safe. Among those unknown cells, (5,2) is one. Thus, it is safe to left-click (5,2).

REASONING:

ACTION:

REASONING: Focusing on (4,3)=1, we note its adjacent cells include (5,3): F, (3,2): opened, (3,3): opened, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=2, (4,4)=2, and two unknown cells: (5,4) and possibly one duplicate entry. Since (4,3) shows a 1 and already has one flagged mine at (5,3), all other adjacent unknown cells must be safe. In this case, (5,4) is unknown and can be safely opened.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (4,4) which displays 2. Its adjacent neighbors include flagged mines (3,5) and (5,3) totaling 2. Since (4,4)’s count of mines is already satisfied with these flags, the other adjacent unknown cells, specifically (4,5) and (5,5), must be safe. Thus, we can safely left-click one of them. Here, I'll choose (4,5).

REASONING: Looking at (4,1)=1, its neighbors include (3,1) and (3,2) (both unopened) along with (4,2) and (5,2) which are already opened and (5,1)=F which is flagged. Since (4,1) shows 1 and (5,1) is flagged, both (3,1) and (3,2) must be safe. We pick one safe move to proceed. Here, I'll left-click (3,1).
