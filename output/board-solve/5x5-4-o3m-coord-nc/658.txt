--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the game is just beginning, we have no information about mine locations. The best strategy is to start with an opening move that offers maximum potential for uncovering a large area of cells. The prompt instructs us to begin by left-clicking the center cell, (3,3), to gain initial clues about surrounding mines. This move is designed to provide the most information for subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Examining (1,4)=1, its neighbors include (1,5) as the only unknown; however, before flagging that, we further analyze (2,1)=1 whose neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). With (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) already safe, (3,1) must be the mine. Next, checking (3,2)=1, its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3). With (3,1) already flagged as a mine and the rest being safe, (4,1) cannot be a mine. Thus, (4,1) is guaranteed safe, and we can open it.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,1) which displays the number "1", we examine its neighbors: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). All of these cells except (3,1) are already revealed safe (either as a blank or numbered). Since (2,1) indicates exactly one mine among its neighbors, the only possibility is that the mine is located at (3,1). Therefore, we flag (3,1) to mark it as a potential mine.

REASONING: Considering cell (1,4) which shows "1", we look at its neighbors: (1,3) is open, (2,3) is open, (2,4) and (2,5) are safe numbered cells, leaving (1,5) as the only unknown neighbor. Since exactly one mine is required among these cells, (1,5) must be the mine. Thus, we flag (1,5).

REASONING: Consider cell (2,2) which shows "1". Its neighbors include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3). Among these, (3,1) is flagged, satisfying the single mine indicated. As a rule, when a numbered cell's mine count equals its flagged neighbors, all remaining unknown neighbors are safe. Consequently, (2,3) and (3,3) are safe to open. I'll choose (2,3) for the next move.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on the bottom row and the constraints from (4,1)=2 and (4,2)=2 helps us deduce a safe move. For (4,1), the unknown neighbors are (5,1) and (5,2), and with its value of 2 and one flagged mine already adjacent (at (3,1)), exactly one of (5,1) or (5,2) must be a mine. For (4,2)=2, its unknown neighbors in the bottom row are (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3), and similarly, exactly one must be a mine. Since (5,1) and (5,2) already contain that one unknown mine for (4,1), (5,3) cannot be a mine. Thus, (5,3) is safe to open.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We now face an ambiguity among the four unknown cells in row 5. Two independent constraints are in play:
• (4,1)=2 and (4,2)=2 require exactly one mine between (5,1) and (5,2).
• (4,3)=1 forces exactly one mine between (5,2) and (5,4).
• Together with (4,4)=1 and (4,5)=1, which require exactly one mine between (5,4) and (5,5), there are two viable assignments: either the mines are at (5,2) and (5,5) or at (5,1) and (5,4).
There is no cell that is safe in both scenarios. Without a logically forced move, we must choose one unknown cell to open. I will pick (5,1) as my next move.

Similarly, (5,4)=1 also confirms that (5,5) is the only remaining possibility for the mine in its neighborhood.
