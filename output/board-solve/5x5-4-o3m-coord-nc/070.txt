--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since this is the start of the game and the board is completely hidden, we follow the common strategy of beginning from the center. Left-clicking the center cell (3,3) provides a balanced chance to reveal useful information about the surrounding area, thereby maximizing the efficiency of subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (4,4) which shows a "3", we observe that its eight neighbors include exactly three cells that remain unopened: (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5). Since the numbered cell indicates there are three mines around it, all these three unopened neighbors must be mines. Therefore, we can safely flag one of them. We'll begin by flagging cell (3,5).

REASONING: Looking at cell (3,1) which shows a "1", its neighbors are: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,1) and (4,2). Among these, all except (2,1) are already opened (cells (2,2)=1, (3,2)=1, (4,1)=., (4,2)=. are open). Thus, the single mine indicated by the "1" must be at (2,1). We can therefore safely flag (2,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The numbered cell (1,2) shows "1" and already has one adjacent cell flagged at (2,1). Its other neighbors (specifically (1,1) and (2,3)) remain unopened. Since the flagged count equals the number shown, we deduce that the remaining unflagged neighbors of (1,2) are safe to open. We can confidently use middle-click on (1,2) to clear its remaining neighbors.

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,2) which shows a "1", its eight neighbors are: (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=F, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=1, and (3,3)=?. With one flagged neighbor (2,1) already matching the "1", the remaining unopened neighbors (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3) are guaranteed safe. Therefore, we can use a middle-click on (2,2) to automatically open these cells.

REASONING: Analyze cell (4,4) displaying "3". Its neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Among these, (3,5) is flagged and the rest are opened except (4,5) and (5,5). Since (4,4) indicates three adjacent mines and only one flag exists, the two remaining unknown neighbors, (4,5) and (5,5), must both be mines. Confirming with cell (5,4)=2—which has unknowns (4,5) and (5,5) and expects two mines—this reasoning is consistent. We can, therefore, safely flag (4,5).

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Inspect cell (4,4) which shows "3". Its eight neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Out of these, (3,5) and (4,5) are already flagged. The remaining neighbors (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5) are opened except for (5,5). Since (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and (5,4) are safe (opened) and only (5,5) is still unopened, it must contain the third mine needed for cell (4,4)’s count. Therefore, we safely flag (5,5).
