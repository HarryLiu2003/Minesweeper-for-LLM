--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since this is the beginning of the game and all cells are unopened, the recommended opening move is to click the central cell for maximum exposure. By revealing the center (3,3), we gather critical information about the surrounding area, which will help in deducing the positions of the mines as the game progresses.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (1,3), which displays the number "1", we examine its neighbors. Its adjacent cells are: (1,2) opened as ".", (2,2) opened as ".", (2,3) opened as "1", and (2,4) opened as "2". The only remaining unrevealed neighbor for (1,3) is (1,4). Since the "1" on (1,3) means exactly one mine exists among its neighbors, (1,4) must be that mine.

REASONING: Look at cell (5,4), which displays "2". Its neighbors are (4,3): ., (4,4): 2, (4,5): ?, (5,3): ., and (5,5): ?. With two unknown neighbors (4,5) and (5,5) and no flags around (5,4), both must be mines to satisfy the "2". Thus, it's safe to flag one of them. I'll flag (4,5) next.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (5,4) which displays the number "2". Its neighbors are (4,3) (opened), (4,4) (opened as "2"), (4,5) (flagged as a mine), (5,3) (opened), and (5,5) (still unrevealed). With "2" indicating two mines around it and one flag already in place at (4,5), the only remaining closed neighbor, (5,5), must be a mine. Thus, we flag (5,5).

REASONING: Label the unopened cells around (2,4) and (3,4): let (1,5) = X, (2,5) = Y, (3,5) = Z where X, Y, Z equal 1 if there's a mine, 0 if safe. From (2,4)=2, its neighbors include flag at (1,4) and X, Y, Z; hence X+Y+Z = 1. From (3,4)=2, its neighbors include flag at (4,5) and Y, Z; hence Y+Z = 1. This forces X = 0, so (1,5) is safe.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examine cell (1,5) showing "2". Its only adjacent unopened cell is (2,5) because (1,4) is flagged. Since (1,5) requires two mines among its neighbors and one mine is already flagged at (1,4), the remaining mine must be at (2,5). Hence, we flag cell (2,5) as it is deduced to contain a mine.

ACTION: R(2,5)
