--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: We are starting a fresh game with a 5x5 board where all cells are currently unopened. A common strategy is to begin with the center cell to maximize the chances of uncovering a large area through cascading blank cell reveals. By opening the center cell at (3,3), we are likely to gain valuable information that will help in deducing the positions of the hidden mines.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Inspecting cell (4,1) which displays a "1", we list its neighbors: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), and (5,2). Among these, (3,2) is open (with a 2), and (4,2), (5,1), (5,2) are revealed safe (blank or numbered). This leaves (3,1) as the only unopened neighbor. Since (4,1)'s clue must account for exactly one mine, (3,1) must be the mine. Thus, the next move is to flag (3,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (3,2), which shows "2", its neighbors are (2,1), (2,2)=3, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,3)=., (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, and (4,3)=. Among these, only (2,1) remains unopened. Since one mine is already flagged at (3,1) and (3,2) indicates two mines in total, the remaining unopened neighbor (2,1) must contain a mine. Therefore, we can confidently flag cell (2,1).

REASONING: Examining cell (4,2) with a value of "1", we note that its neighbors are (3,1): F, (3,2): 2, (3,3): ., (4,1): 1, (4,3): ., (5,1): ., (5,2): ?, and (5,3): ?. With one mine already flagged at (3,1) fulfilling its clue, the remaining unopened neighbors (5,2) and (5,3) must be safe. I will select cell (5,2) to open.

ACTION: L(5,2)

Your previous action "L(5,2)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider the clues from (2,2)=3 and (2,3)=1. For (2,2), its unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) must contain exactly one mine (since two mines are already flagged). For (2,3), its unopened neighbors (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) likewise must hold one mine. In either case, the mine must be in (1,2) or (1,3), meaning (1,4) is not a mine. Thus, cell (1,4) is safe to open.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (1,3) which displays a "1", we list its neighbors: (1,2) is the only unopened adjacent cell (with (1,4) already opened and other neighbors in row 2 being numbered). Since it must have exactly one mine around it, the unopened cell (1,2) must be that mine. Therefore, we flag (1,2) as a mine.

Thus, any remaining unopened neighbor—in this case (1,1)—must be safe. We can use a middle-click on (2,2) to reveal (1,1).
