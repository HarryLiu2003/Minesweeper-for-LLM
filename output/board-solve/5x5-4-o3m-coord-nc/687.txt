--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since the board is completely unopened at the start, our first move, as instructed, is to left-click the center cell at (3,3). This will initiate the game and potentially reveal useful numbers or blanks to help deduce safe moves for subsequent clicks.

ACTION: L(3,3)

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (1,4), which is numbered "1", we examine its neighbors. Its adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5). Out of these, (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (2,5) are already opened, leaving (1,3) as the sole unknown neighbor. Since cell (1,4) must have exactly one mine around it, it is clear that (1,3) has to be a mine. Therefore, we flag (1,3).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Looking at cell (2,1) which shows "2", its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). Among these, (1,1) and (1,2) are the only unopened cells while the others are already revealed. With (2,1) needing two mines around it and no mines flagged among its neighbors yet, both (1,1) and (1,2) must be mines. To proceed safely, we can flag one of these. I will flag cell (1,1) first.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) displays a "1" and has exactly one adjacent flagged cell at (1,3). This means all other neighboring cells of (2,4) are safe to open. Among these safe neighbors, (3,3) is still unopened. Therefore, we can confidently left-click (3,3).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,4) which shows "1", we check its eight neighbors. Its adjacent cells include (1,3)=F (flagged) and several opened cells [(1,4)=1, (1,5)=., (2,3)=2, (2,5)=.] as well as two unopened cells [(3,4) and (3,5)]. Since (2,4) already has one flagged neighbor matching its count of 1, the remaining unopened neighbors must be safe. Choosing one of these safe cells, we can confidently left-click cell (3,4).

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Analyzing cell (2,1) which shows "2", its neighbors are (1,1)=F, (1,2)=? (unopened), (2,2)=3, (3,1)=., and (3,2)=. Since one flagged mine is already present at (1,1), the remaining mine must be among its unopened neighbors—in this case, (1,2). Additionally, cell (2,2) displays "3" and its only remaining unopened neighbor is (1,2). Therefore, (1,2) must be a mine. We can safely flag cell (1,2).
