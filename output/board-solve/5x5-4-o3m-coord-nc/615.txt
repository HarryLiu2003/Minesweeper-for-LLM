--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Since no moves have been made and the board is completely unopened, as per the instructions we must start the game by left-clicking the center cell located at (3,3). This move will reveal information that can guide subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: The cell at (1,3) shows a "1" and its neighboring cells include (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Among these, (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4) are already revealed, leaving (1,2) as the only unopened neighbor. Since (1,3) indicates only one adjacent mine, (1,2) must contain that mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Inspecting the cell at (2,3) which shows a "1", we list its neighbors: (1,2) is flagged, (1,3) and (1,4) are revealed, (2,2) is revealed, (2,4) is revealed, (3,2) is revealed, (3,4) is revealed, and only (3,3) remains unopened. With (2,3) already accounting for one flagged mine among its neighbors, the remaining adjacent cell (3,3) must be safe. Therefore, we can confidently left-click (3,3).

ACTION: L(3,3)

>> USER:
Your previous action "L(3,3)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a blank cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').
Please follow the instructions and try again.

REASONING: The cell at (2,3) shows a "1" and its eight neighbors include one flagged mine at (1,2) while the other adjacent cells are either revealed or unopened. Since the flagged count exactly matches the number on (2,3), the conditions are met to safely reveal all unflagged neighbors by performing a middle-click on (2,3).

REASONING:

REASONING: Let's inspect cell (4,5), which displays "1". Its neighbors are (3,4): opened, (3,5): opened, (4,4): "1", (5,4): "1", and (5,5): unopened ("?"). Since (4,5) requires one mine and there are no flagged cells around it yet, the only possibility is that the unopened cell (5,5) must be the mine. Therefore, we should flag (5,5).

REASONING: Looking at cell (2,3) which displays "1", we check its adjacent cells. Its neighbors include the flagged cell (1,2) while (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), and (3,2) are already revealed. The remaining unrevealed adjacent cells are (3,3) and (3,4). Since the flag count equals the number on (2,3), it is safe to reveal the remaining blank neighbors. We can do this via a middle-click on (2,3).

This leaves (3,4) and (3,5) as unopened. The flagged mine count equals the number on (4,5), so by Minesweeper rules, it’s safe to reveal all its other unopened neighbors.
