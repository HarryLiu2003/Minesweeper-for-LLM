--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: At the start of the game, with no cells revealed, a common initial strategy is to uncover a central cell to gather as much information as possible. By left-clicking (3,3), we open a central location that maximizes our chances of revealing a blank or low-number cell, which in turn can open additional safe cells automatically. This move sets a strong foundation for identifying nearby mines and making informed decisions on subsequent moves.

REASONING: The cell at (3,4) shows a 1, meaning exactly one mine exists among its adjacent cells. Its neighbors are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Except for (2,5), all neighbors are already revealed (as numbers or blanks). Thus, (2,5) must contain a mine, and we can safely flag it.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Examining (2,3) which shows a 2, its unknown neighbors are (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4) – these must contain exactly 2 mines. Meanwhile, (2,4) shows a 2 with one flagged neighbor already at (2,5), making its unknown neighbors (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) require exactly 1 additional mine. In order for (2,3)’s group to total 2 mines while (2,4)’s group only has 1 mine among (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5), (1,2) must be the other mine. This forces (1,2) to be a mine.

REASONING: Looking at cell (3,2) which shows a "1", its eight neighbors include one flagged cell at (3,1), with all the other neighbors already revealed except for (2,1). Since (3,2) already has its required mine flagged, the remaining unknown neighbor (2,1) must be safe to open.

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,1) which displays a "2", its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), and (3,2). Among these, (1,2) and (3,1) are flagged, fulfilling the requirement for two adjacent mines. Thus, (1,1) must be safe. We can confidently open (1,1) with a left-click.

With two flags already in place ((1,2) and (3,1)), the requirement of two adjacent mines is met, meaning any remaining unknown neighbor must be safe. The only unrevealed neighbor in this group is (1,3). Therefore, (1,3) is safe to open.

REASONING: Consider cell (1,3) which shows a "2". Its neighbors are (1,2): F, (1,4): ?; and the cells in row 2 are all revealed numbers. With one flagged mine already present at (1,2), the "2" indicates that one more mine must be among its neighbors. The only unknown neighbor is (1,4), which must harbor the second mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (1,4).
