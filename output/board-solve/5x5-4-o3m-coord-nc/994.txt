--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: To begin the game and gather some essential information about mine placements, we will start by opening the central cell. The center of the board, located at (3,3), offers the maximum adjacency to other cells. Revealing this cell is likely to either provide a number indicating nearby mines or produce a blank cell, which would then automatically open adjacent safe cells. This move will help us gain insight into the overall board configuration and set up safer moves in subsequent steps.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING: Focusing on cell (2,4) which shows "1", we examine its 8 neighboring cells. All its neighbors are already opened except (3,5). Since (2,4) requires exactly one neighboring mine and no flags are present, (3,5) must contain the mine. Flagging (3,5) is therefore the safest move.

REASONING: Focusing on the cells in the bottom left, note that (4,1) shows a "1" and its unknown neighbors are (5,1) and (5,2), meaning one of them must be a mine. Next, (4,2) shows "1" with unknown neighbors (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3). Since (4,2) must have exactly one mine and (4,1) already confines that mine to (5,1) or (5,2), (5,3) cannot be a mine. Therefore, itâ€™s safe to left-click (5,3).

REASONING: Focusing on cell (3,4), which displays "1", we inspect its 8 neighbors. Its neighbors are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Among these, only (3,5) is flagged, satisfying the "1" count. This implies that all other adjacent cells, including (4,5), must be safe. Therefore, we can safely left-click on cell (4,5).

REASONING: Looking at cell (4,4), which shows "3", we examine its eight neighbors. Its neighbors are (3,3): safe, (3,4): 1, (3,5): F, (4,3): 1, (4,5): 3, (5,3): 1, and the two unknown cells (5,4) and (5,5). With one mine already flagged at (3,5), the cell (4,4) still requires two additional mines among its neighbors. The only candidates remaining are (5,4) and (5,5). Hence, both must be mines. To proceed safely, we flag one unknown mine at a time. I'll flag (5,4).

REASONING: Looking at cell (4,5) which shows "3", its neighbors include (3,4): 1, (3,5): F, (4,4): 3, (5,4): F, and the unknown (5,5). With two flags already placed among its neighbors, it still requires one additional mine to satisfy the count. Since (5,5) is the only unknown neighbor around (4,5), (5,5) must be a mine. Thus, we flag (5,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: Consider cell (4,1) showing "1". Its neighbors include (3,1), (3,2), (4,2) (all safe), and the unknown cells (5,1) and (5,2). The "1" indicates exactly one mine among them. Now, looking at (4,2) which also shows "1", its neighbors are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3) with (5,3) being safe. This also implies exactly one mine among (5,1) and (5,2). Additionally, (5,3) shows "1" and sees a flagged mine at (5,4), meaning (5,2) must be safe (or else (5,3)'s count would exceed 1). Therefore, the only candidate remaining to be the mine is (5,1). We flag (5,1).

ACTION: R(5,1)
