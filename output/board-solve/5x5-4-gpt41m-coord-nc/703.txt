--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal it. This will give us a starting point with some numbers or a blank cell, which will help us deduce the positions of mines in subsequent moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cells (2,2) and (2,3) both show "3", indicating each has three mines in their adjacent cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1). The unopened neighbors of (2,3) are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (2,4). The cell (2,4) shows "2" and has unopened neighbors (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5). The cell (2,5) shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (1,5). Since (2,5) is "1" and only (1,5) is unopened around it, (1,5) must be a mine. We can flag (1,5) safely.

REASONING: The cell (2,4) shows "2" and has unopened neighbors (1,4) and (1,5). Since (1,5) is flagged as a mine, the other mine must be at (1,4). We can safely flag (1,4) as a mine.

REASONING: The cell (2,2) shows "3" and has unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1). The cell (2,3) also shows "3" and has unopened neighbors (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1). Since both need 3 mines and the flagged mines are at (1,4) and (1,5), the three mines must be among (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1). The cell (3,1) shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (2,1) and (2,2). Since (2,2) is already opened and shows "3", the mine adjacent to (3,1) must be at (2,1). We can flag (2,1) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell (2,2) shows "3" and has unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) remaining, with (2,1) flagged as a mine. The cell (2,3) also shows "3" and has unopened neighbors (1,2), (1,3), and (3,1), with (2,1) flagged. Since both need 3 mines and one is flagged at (2,1), the other two mines must be among (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (3,1). The cell (3,1) shows "1" and has only one unopened neighbor (3,1) itself is opened, so the mine must be at (1,1), (1,2), or (1,3). Since (3,1) is "1" and (2,1) is flagged, the mine adjacent to (3,1) is already accounted for. Therefore, (3,1) is safe to open.

ACTION: L(3,1)

Your previous action "L(3,1)" is invalid. Error Message:
Invalid action: Cannot left-click a numbered cell. Left-click is only for unopened cells (`?').

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell (3,1) is already opened and shows "1". The unopened neighbors of (2,2) and (2,3) are (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). Since (2,2) and (2,3) both show "3" and (2,1), (1,4), and (1,5) are flagged, the three mines must be among (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3). The cell (2,4) shows "2" and has unopened neighbors (1,4) flagged and (1,5) flagged, so all mines around (2,4) are flagged. Therefore, the unopened neighbors of (2,4) other than flagged cells are safe to open. The only unopened neighbor of (2,4) that is not flagged is (1,3). But (1,3) is in the mine group, so let's check (2,5) which shows "1" and has only (1,5) flagged. So (1,5) is the only mine around (2,5). We can safely open the unopened neighbors of (2,5) other than flagged cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,5) are (1,5) flagged, so no other unopened neighbors. Let's look at (3,2) which shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (1,2), (2,2), and (3,1). Since (2,2) is opened and (3,1) is opened, the mine must be at (1,2). So (1,2) is a mine. We can flag (1,2).
