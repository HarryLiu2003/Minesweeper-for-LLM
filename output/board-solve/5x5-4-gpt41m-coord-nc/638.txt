--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal some information about the surrounding mines. This is a common strategy in Minesweeper to maximize the chance of opening a blank or numbered cell and gaining useful clues.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,2) shows "1", indicating there is exactly one mine in its adjacent cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,2) are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1). Similarly, the cell at (3,2) also shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (3,1), (4,1), and (4,2) (but (4,2) is opened and shows "2"). Since (3,2) has only one mine adjacent and (4,2) shows "2", the mine must be among the unopened cells adjacent to (4,2). The unopened cells adjacent to (4,2) are (4,1), (5,1), and (5,2). The cell (4,2) shows "2", so there are two mines among these unopened cells. The cell (2,2) and (3,2) both indicate one mine adjacent, and the only common unopened cell is (3,1). So, (3,1) is likely a mine. I will flag (3,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,2) shows "1" and now has one flagged neighbor (3,1), so all mines around (2,2) are flagged. We can safely open the other unopened neighbors of (2,2), which are (1,1) and (2,1). The cell at (3,2) also shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor (3,1), so all mines around (3,2) are flagged. We can safely open the other unopened neighbors of (3,2), which are (4,1) and (4,2) (already opened). To proceed safely, I will left-click (1,1) to reveal more information.

The cell at (2,2) shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor (3,1), so all mines around (2,2) are flagged. Therefore, (2,1) must be a mine. I will flag (2,1).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,2) shows "1" and has two flagged neighbors (2,1) and (3,1), which means one of these flags is incorrect because it only indicates one mine adjacent. Since both are flagged, one flag must be removed. However, the cell at (3,2) also shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor (3,1), so the flag at (3,1) is correct. Therefore, the flag at (2,1) must be removed. I will right-click (2,1) to remove the flag.
