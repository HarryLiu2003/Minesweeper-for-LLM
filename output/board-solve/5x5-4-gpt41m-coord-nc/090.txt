--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal some numbers or blanks, which will give us clues about the surrounding mines.

ACTION: L(3,3)

ACTION:

REASONING: The cell at (2,3) shows "1", and its neighbors include (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4). Among these, (2,2) is "2", (2,4) is "1", and (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are ".", so no mines there. The unopened neighbors of (2,3) are (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4). Since (2,3) has only one mine adjacent, and the other neighbors are safe, the mine must be in one of these unopened cells. Similarly, (2,2) shows "2" and has unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (3,1). Since (3,1) is ".", it is safe. So the mines are likely in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), or (2,1). The cell (2,1) is unopened and adjacent to (2,2) and (2,1) is likely a mine. To confirm, let's flag (2,1) as a mine.

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: I mistakenly tried to flag a numbered cell at (2,1). Instead, I should flag an unopened cell. Looking at the board, the cell (5,3) is unopened and adjacent to (5,2) which shows "1". Since (5,2) has only one mine adjacent and all other neighbors are opened or safe, (5,3) must be a mine. I will place a flag on (5,3).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (5,2) shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor at (5,3), which matches the number of mines around it. Therefore, all other unopened neighbors of (5,2) are safe to open. The unopened neighbors of (5,2) are none except the flagged (5,3). Now, looking at (4,2), which shows "1", it has one flagged neighbor at (5,3) diagonally, so other unopened neighbors of (4,2) are safe. The unopened neighbors of (4,2) are (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (5,1), and (5,2). Among these, (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), and (5,1) are already opened as ".", so no action needed there. Now, looking at (2,1) which shows "2", it has unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,1). Among these, (2,2) is "2" and (3,1) is ".", so the mines must be in (1,1) and (1,2). I will flag (1,1) as a mine.

REASONING: The cell at (2,1) shows "2" and has one flagged neighbor at (1,1). It needs one more mine in its neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (2,1) are (1,2) and (2,2). The cell (2,2) shows "2" and has unopened neighbors (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3). Since (2,3) is "1" and has no flagged neighbors, the mine must be in (1,2) or (1,3). Given that (2,1) needs one more mine and (2,2) needs two mines, and (1,1) is flagged, the mine at (1,2) is likely. I will flag (1,2).

REASONING: The cell at (1,3) shows "1" and has two flagged neighbors at (1,1) and (1,2). Since it only indicates one mine adjacent, and two neighbors are flagged, one of the flags must be incorrect. However, since both flags are consistent with other numbers, the flagged cells are likely correct. The unopened neighbors of (1,3) are (1,4) and (2,4). The cell at (2,4) shows "1" and has no flagged neighbors yet, so the mine must be at (1,4). I will flag (1,4).
