--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal some numbers or blanks, which will give us clues about the surrounding mines.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) shows "3", indicating there are three mines in its adjacent cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (2,5), and (3,5). Since there are four unopened neighbors but only three mines, one of these cells is safe to open. The cell (1,5) is unopened and not adjacent to (2,4), so it is not constrained by this clue. However, the cell (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2) which shows "1" and (2,3) which shows "2". The cell (1,3) is likely a mine because (1,2) has only one adjacent mine and (1,3) is the only unopened neighbor of (1,2). So, we can flag (1,3) as a mine.

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) shows "3" and now has one flagged mine at (1,3). It has three unopened neighbors: (1,4), (2,5), and (3,5). Since it needs three mines total and one is flagged, the other two unopened neighbors must also be mines. We can flag (1,4) and (2,5) as mines. Let's flag (1,4) first.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) shows "3" and has two flagged mines at (1,3) and (1,4). It has one unopened neighbor left at (2,5). Since the total number of mines around (2,4) is 3 and two are flagged, the last unopened neighbor (2,5) must also be a mine. We should flag (2,5).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,3) shows "2" and has two flagged neighbors at (1,3) and (2,5). Since all mines around (2,3) are flagged, we can safely open the remaining unopened neighbors of (2,3). The unopened neighbors are (2,4) which is already opened, and (3,4) which is opened, and (3,3) which is opened, so no unopened neighbors remain. Let's check another cell.

The cell at (1,2) shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor at (1,3). All mines around (1,2) are flagged, so we can safely open the unopened neighbors of (1,2). The unopened neighbors are (1,1) and (2,1). Both are unopened. Since (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,2) which shows "1", and (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) and (3,1) which is opened, it is safer to open (1,1) first.

REASONING: I mistakenly tried to left-click an already opened blank cell at (1,1). Instead, I should focus on unopened cells. The cell at (1,2) shows "1" and has one flagged neighbor at (1,3), so all mines around it are flagged. We can safely open the other unopened neighbor of (1,2), which is (1,5).
