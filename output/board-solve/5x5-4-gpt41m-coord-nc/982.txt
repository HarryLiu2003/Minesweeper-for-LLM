--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal some information about the surrounding mines. This is a common strategy to start the game and maximize the chance of opening a blank or numbered cell that will help us deduce mine locations.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) shows "3", indicating there are three mines in its adjacent cells. The unopened neighbors of (2,4) are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5). The cells (2,2) and (2,3) both show "2", and their unopened neighbors overlap with those of (2,4). Since (2,4) requires three mines and (2,2) and (2,3) require two mines each, the unopened cells around these numbers are likely to contain mines. The unopened cells (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) are common neighbors to these numbered cells and are the most probable mine locations. We should flag (1,3) as a mine.

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (2,4) shows "3" and currently has one flagged neighbor at (1,3). It still needs two more mines among its unopened neighbors: (1,4), (1,5), and (2,5). The cells (2,2) and (2,3) both show "2" and share neighbors with (2,4). Since (1,3) is flagged, the remaining mines for (2,2) and (2,3) must be among (1,2), (1,4), and (2,1), (2,5). The cell (1,4) is a common neighbor to all these numbered cells and is likely a mine. I will flag (1,4).

ACTION:

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) shows "2", indicating two mines among its neighbors. One flagged mine is at (1,4), so there must be one more mine among the unopened neighbors (1,1), (1,2), and (2,5). The cells (2,2) and (2,3) both show "2" and have flagged neighbors at (1,3) and (1,4), so their remaining mines must be among (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,5). The cell (2,5) is a common neighbor to (1,5), (2,3), and (2,4), and since (2,4) needs one more mine, (2,5) is likely a mine. I will flag (2,5).

REASONING: The cell at (2,2) shows "2" and has two flagged neighbors at (1,3) and (1,4), so all its mines are flagged. The same applies to (2,3) which also shows "2" and has two flagged neighbors at (1,3) and (1,4). Since all mines around (2,2) and (2,3) are flagged, we can safely open their other unopened neighbors. The unopened neighbors of (2,2) and (2,3) that are not flagged are (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1). We can safely open (1,1) to gain more information.

REASONING:

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (1,1) shows "1", indicating one mine among its neighbors. The flagged cell (1,3) is not a neighbor of (1,1), so the mine must be among (1,2) or (2,1). The cell at (3,1) shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (2,1) and (2,2). Since (2,2) shows "2" and already has two flagged neighbors, the mine near (3,1) must be at (2,1). Therefore, (2,1) is a mine and should be flagged.

ACTION: R(2,1)
