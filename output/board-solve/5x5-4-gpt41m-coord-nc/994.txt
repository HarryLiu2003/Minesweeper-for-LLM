--- MINESWEEPER INTRODUCTION ---
In Minesweeper, 4 hidden mines are scattered throughout a 5 by 5 board, which is divided into cells. The cells are presented as "coordinate: state" mappings. A coordinate (x,y) represents the element at the x-th row and y-th column in the board, where x and y, starting from 1, are the row and column indices, respectively. Cells have multiple possible states:
- Unopened cells (represented by "?", which cover the board at the start of the game, can also be made by removing flags)
- Numbered cells (represented by "1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8", which indicate the number of mines in the eight neighboring cells, including those diagonally adjacent)
- Blank cells (represented by ".", which have no neighboring mines)
- Flagged cells (represented by "F", which are marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location)

A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a cell containing a mine, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile (sometimes shown as a 0), and all adjacent cells will automatically be opened. To win a game of Minesweeper, all non-mine cells must be opened without opening a mine.

--- ACTION OPTIONS ---
There are three permissible actions in Minesweeper:

- Left-click an unopened cell ("?") to reveal it.
- Right-click an unopened cell ("?") to place a flag or a flagged cell ("F") to remove the flag.
- Middle-click on a numbered cell ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8") to unveil its neighboring cells, but only if all adjacent mines have been correctly flagged. If any flags are misplaced, you'll lose the game.

--- ACTION FORMAT ---
Each of your actions should be formatted as "A(row,col)", where:
- "A" represents the action type: "L" denotes a left-click, "R" indicates a right-click, and "M" signifies a middle-click.
- "row" specifies the row number of the targeted cell.
- "col" details the column number of the targeted cell.
For instance, an action like "L(1,2)" translates to a left-click on the cell located at the first row and second column.

please ensure:
- You do not duplicate actions.
- You submit only one action at a time.

--- EXAMPLES ---
Example 1:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): .
(1,2): 1
(1,3): ?
(1,4): ?
(2,1): .
(2,2): 1
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): .
(3,2): 1
(3,3): 2
(3,4): 4
(4,1): .
(4,2): .
(4,3): .
(4,4): 2

REASONING: The cell located at (3,2) displays the number "1", indicating there's a single mine in its neighboring cells. Among these neighbors, 7 are opened as empty or numbered, and only one remains unopened at (2,3). Given that there's just one adjacent mine, it's logical to deduce that the unopened cell at (2,3) contains the mine. Thus, our next move is to flag the cell at (2,3) with a right-click.

ACTION: R(2,3)

Example 2:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,4): .
(1,5): 1
(1,6): ?
(1,7): ?
(2,4): .
(2,5): 1
(2,6): F
(2,7): ?
(3,4): .
(3,5): 1
(3,6): 2
(3,7): 4
(4,4): .
(4,5): .
(4,6): .
(4,7): 2

REASONING: The cell at (1,5) displays the number "1", indicating a single adjacent mine. Upon examining its neighboring cells, only the cell at (2,6) is flagged with "F". This suggests that all mines neighboring (1,5) have been identified. Consequently, we can safely unveil the other surrounding cells by middle-clicking on (1,5).

ACTION: M(1,5)

Example 3:
Notice that the board is displayed in partial.

--- BOARD ---
(1,1): 1
(1,2): 1
(1,3): 2
(1,4): ?
(2,1): ?
(2,2): ?
(2,3): ?
(2,4): ?
(3,1): ?
(3,2): ?
(3,3): ?
(3,4): ?

REASONING: The cell at (1,1) indicates there's a single mine amongst its neighbors. Examining the cells adjacent to it, both (2,1) and (2,2) remain unopened, implying one of them contains a mine. Similarly, the cell at (1,2) displays a "1", suggesting that out of (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3), one holds a mine. Since one of (2,1) or (2,2) already contains a mine, it becomes evident that (2,3) is mine-free. We can then safely uncover (2,3) with a left-click.

ACTION: L(2,3)

--- RESPONSE GUIDE ---
Let's think step by step.

Begin by detailing your rationale in the "REASONING" section, followed by specifying your move using the previously mentioned format in the "ACTION" section. Ensure your reasoning doesn't exceed 200 words. To commence the game, left-click the center cell at (3, 3).

REASONING:
ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The board is completely unopened, so we have no information about mine locations yet. The best initial move is to left-click the center cell (3,3) to reveal some information about the surrounding mines. This will open the cell and potentially reveal numbers or blanks, giving us clues for the next moves.

ACTION: L(3,3)

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows "3", indicating there are three mines in its adjacent cells. The unopened neighbors of (4,4) are (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Among these, there are 3 mines. The cells (4,5), (5,4), and (5,5) are the most likely candidates for mines because (5,3) and (3,5) are adjacent to other cells with low numbers, making them less likely to be mines. We should flag (4,5) as a mine to start marking the mines around (4,4).

REASONING:

ACTION:


>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows "3" and currently has one flagged mine at (4,5). It still needs two more mines among its unopened neighbors: (3,5), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). The cell at (4,3) shows "1" and has no flagged neighbors yet. Its unopened neighbors are (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), and (5,4). Since (4,4) is not a mine, and (4,3) has only one mine adjacent, the mine must be among (3,5), (5,3), or (5,4). The cell at (3,4) shows "1" and has unopened neighbors (3,5), (4,4), and (4,5). Since (4,5) is flagged and (4,4) is not a mine, the mine adjacent to (3,4) is (3,5). So, (3,5) must be a mine. Let's flag (3,5).

>> ASSISTANT:
REASONING: The cell at (5,3) shows "1", indicating one mine adjacent to it. The flagged mine at (4,5) is not adjacent to (5,3), but the flagged mine at (3,5) is adjacent to (5,3). The unopened neighbors of (5,3) are (5,2), (5,4), and (4,4). Since (4,4) is already opened and shows "3", the mine adjacent to (5,3) must be among (5,2) and (5,4). The cell at (4,4) shows "3" and has two flagged mines at (3,5) and (4,5), so it needs one more mine among (5,4) and (5,5). The cell at (5,4) is adjacent to both (4,4) and (5,3), so it is the common mine for both. We should flag (5,4).

REASONING: The cell at (4,4) shows "3" and has three flagged mines at (3,5), (4,5), and (5,4), so all its mines are flagged. We can safely middle-click (4,4) to reveal all its unopened neighbors, which are (5,3) (already opened), (5,5), and (5,2). This will help us uncover more cells safely.
